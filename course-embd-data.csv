AH 2109,Toward a Rigorous Art History,9/3/2024,12/13/2024,9/3/2024,12/13/2024,1,J. Vanessa,Lyon,vanessalyon@bennington.edu,Visual Arts,On Campus,"A “rigorous study of art” became the goal of Philosopher and Cultural Critic Walter Benjamin (1892-1940) when his growing distaste for the outlook and methods of his art history professor—the famous and foundational Heinrich Wölfflin—caused him to consider publishing an account of “the most disastrous activity I have ever encountered at a German university.”

Striking a balance between Benjamin’s histories of the marginal and Wölfflin’s big picture formalism, this wide-ranging introductory course requires the serious, if necessarily fast-paced, analysis (and memorization) of a broad constellation of paintings, prints, drawings, sculpture, architecture, monuments, and examples of material and visual culture across both time and place. Along the journey students will acquaint themselves with various art historical methodologies, critical terms, and disciplinary controversies. Mid-term/Final/Short papers."
AH 4117,The Baroque Imaginary,9/3/2024,12/13/2024,9/3/2024,12/13/2024,1,J. Vanessa,Lyon,vanessalyon@bennington.edu,Visual Arts,On Campus,"The concept of the Baroque has long fascinated—and incensed—historians, literary critics, and philosophers. Often aligned with an artistic ‘Golden Age’ exemplified by the complex and discomfiting works of Bernini, Rubens, Velázquez, and Vermeer, the Baroque has also been associated with ruinous decadence and excess, irrationality, preciosity, and effeminacy—rhetorically charged notions that can be interpreted in both religious and gendered terms. This course is an investigation of both seventeenth-century European painting, prints, and sculpture and (Neo)Baroque aesthetics as such. Throughout, we will endeavor to identify at least some of the characteristic mentalities, themes, heuristics, and conceits that constitute the representational-epistemological—and certainly, the metaphysical—mechanics of this rich and varied mode or modes of artistic expression. A comparative essay, museum visit/s, and sustained original research will culminate in a research paper and presentation."
ANT 2107,Embracing Difference,9/3/2024,12/13/2024,9/3/2024,12/13/2024,1,Miroslava,Prazak,mprazak@bennington.edu,Society Culture and Thought,On Campus,"Why are cultures and societies so different, and simultaneously, so similar? This introductory course examines some of the theoretical and methodological approaches of anthropology in exploring human culture and society. We explore various ethnographic examples to develop an anthropological perspective on economy and politics, social organization, kinship and family life, ideology and ritual, ecology and adaptation, as well as a focus on the sources and dynamics of inequality. Further, we focus on the dynamics of change in contemporary life-globalization, migration, political collapse, environmental calamity and social reorganization-and how these processes challenge social scientists to construct appropriate paradigms to describe and understand the production of cultural meanings in the increasingly globalized world, and to identify cultural differences and human universals."

Through ethnographic research, students explore the social construction of drug use; drug control policy and enforcement; global drug markets; and pharmaceuticalization."
ANT 2210,Structures of Power in Society,9/3/2024,12/13/2024,9/3/2024,12/13/2024,1,Miroslava,Prazak,mprazak@bennington.edu,Society Culture and Thought,On Campus,"Behind any social scene, mundane or extraordinary, lie structures of power. The goals of anthropology include unmasking these structures--the deep complexities of how humans organize themselves in groups. In this course we will explore the structures of gender, kinship, sexuality, race, ethnicity, and class to learn and develop analytical tools to navigate carefully, see deeply and engage fully the world around us."
ANT 4239,Reproductive Justice in Latin America,9/3/2024,12/13/2024,9/3/2024,12/13/2024,1,Cecilia,Salvi,ceciliasalvi@bennington.edu,Society Culture and Thought,On Campus,"This course explores the movement for reproductive justice throughout Latin America since the 1970s, and focuses on the international and interregional cooperation among non-state actors to decriminalize abortion and end violence against women. Topics include reproductive rights versus reproductive justice, obstetric violence, ‘la ola verde’, and post-dictatorship political dynamics. Special emphasis is placed on engaging with the work of scholars and activists from the region."
APA 2020,Introduction to International Law,10/24/2024,11/14/2024,10/24/2024,11/14/2024,3,Andrea,Galindo,andreagalindo@bennington.edu,Advancement of Public Action,On Campus,"This is an introductory course to international public law and its relevance in today’s complex and interconnected world. International law can be considered as the law governing the relations between States, but it also includes relations with international organizations, corporations, and civil society organizations. It is also the foundation for International Human Rights Law, Humanitarian law and International Criminal Law.

Despite their differences in size, power, culture, religion and ideologies, states rely on international law to cooperate and to coexist. International law serves them as an important common language.

Roosevelt alerted Americans to the impending global conflict pitting democracies founded on individual liberty against rising fascist dictatorships pursuing “final solutions.” Drawing inspiration from John Dewey’s progressive philosophy, FDR emphasized, """"In this conflict the part which education plays in each ideology is crucial. Democracy cannot succeed unless those who express their choice are prepared to choose wisely.""""

This course examines the building blocks and animating principles of representative democracy. We focus on education as the bedrock of an informed citizenry that champions the principles and freedoms at the heart of American democracy. We will explore the essence of democracy and devise strategies for meaningful engagement. Topics and materials include America’s foundational documents, the nexus of education and democracy, media influence, social justice debates, economic crises, technological instability, environmental stewardship, and the global drift into authoritarianism. Whether you seek to deepen your understanding of democracy or reignite your commitment to civic responsibility, we invite you to join us.

This two-credit seminar combines Monday evening classes with the Thursday evening Public Policy Forum. We will explore readings and topics in detail on Mondays and prepare students to engage actively with our Thursday evening guest speakers, panel discussions, and breakout sessions. Students are also expected to submit weekly response papers."
APA 2027,Creating A Successful Residential Community,9/3/2024,12/13/2024,9/3/2024,12/13/2024,1,Li-Chen,Chin,lichenchin@bennington.edu,Advancement of Public Action,On Campus,"Living on campus is an essential part of the Bennington student experience. As the College has one of the more economically and culturally diverse student bodies compared to other elite colleges and universities in the United States, how can students connect with and support one another in a meaningful way and create an inclusive and equitable residential community in this digital post-pandemic era? Based on college student development and Intercultural communication theories, public health framework, and restorative justice, the class will provide current knowledge and develop skills essential to creating and facilitating a positive house culture."

Growing local food is one significant way we can respond. Having received the Bennington Fair Food Initiative Grant with the mission to develop educational training programs in agriculture/food system workforce development and to create small business, this class will be practice based learning in regenerative agricultural practices and the creation of sustainable food systems. The course will combine hands-on learning at the farm with classroom work to gain knowledge on how to create and develop a project. We will do a broad overview of project management, writing a mission statement, creating a budget, how to work collaboratively, marketing and grant writing. We will use the farm as material, learning about organic farm production, processing, natural dye making, flowers, beekeeping, medicinal herbs, and mushroom cultivation. All students will be expected to develop and design a project working with fellow students."
APA 2350,Campaign Coverage in an Age of Disinformation,9/3/2024,10/17/2024,9/3/2024,10/17/2024,1,Andrea,Bernstein,andreabernstein@bennington.edu,Advancement of Public Action,On Campus,"Taking Hannah Arendt’s 1967 New Yorker article “Truth and Politics” as a foundational text, this course will examine how the 2024 election is being covered, and should be covered, in an age when basic facts about politics, history, and voting itself are in dispute. Truth and politics have always lived in a wary co-existence, as Arendt writes, but the modern tools of campaigning—which include misinformation, deceptive use of social media, AI and attacking the press as the enemy—make establishing the basic consensus around which democracy is framed nearly impossible.

We’ll begin the class with the classic movie All the President’s Men, and examine coverage of the contested outcome of the Bush v. Gore race. We’ll look at the tools and methods of disinformation campaigns abroad and at home in the 2016 and 2020 elections, through reports, hearings, podcasts and book excerpts. The course will then turn to the 2024 presidential campaign by examining paid and social media, debates, television shows and other messaging in an era when, as Arendt presciently wrote, “the sense by which we take our bearings in the real world…is being destroyed.” The course will conclude with identifying models for hope and resilience. Students will be highly encouraged to attend the fall Public Policy Forums, which will comprise part of the material for the class."
APA 2351,Improvisation for a Catastrophe: Complexity and Resilience,9/3/2024,10/17/2024,9/3/2024,10/17/2024,1,Susan,Sgorbati,sgorbati@bennington.edu,Advancement of Public Action,On Campus,"This class will examine the principles of complex systems, improvisation and resilience. Concepts such as self-organization, emergence, pattern recognition, adaptation and non-linear structures will be introduced. Ordinarily, we think of order and form as externally imposed, composed or directed. In this class, however, we will consider new kinds of order, not because they are preconceived or designed, but because they are the products of dynamic, self-organizing systems operating in open-ended environments. This phenomenon – the creation of order from a rich array of self-organizing interactions – is found not only in artistic processes, but in a wide variety of natural settings when a range of initial conditions gives rise to collective behavior that is both different from and more than the sum of its parts. Like certain art forms, evolution, for example, is decidedly improvisational and emergent, as is the brain function that lies at the center of what it is to be human. Students will practice their own improvisational forms in whatever discipline they want to work in to prepare to live resiliently in a complex world."

This course approaches science and technology as a history of the present; that is, as an unfolding set of epistemic deployments that is actively shaping the texture and significance of social life in the present. We will revisit some of the now classic debates that first gave analytical momentum to the study of science as well as familiarize ourselves with some key arguments that are changing the study science and technology today. Several questions will guide our inquiries: What, exactly, do scientists do? What status does scientific knowledge have? What kind of society is enacted in scientific practice and used technologies? Our readings will touch on a number of topics, including: the separation of nature from the social; the historical contexts and applications of science; techniques of scientific practice like the translation of nature, the gendered dynamics of scientific knowledge, and objectivity as a disembodied vision; and the societies and subjects that science creates. This course will tack back and forth between how anthropology has engaged and explained science and the problems that press into our lives that only science seems capable of taming like genetics, the economy, and climate change."
APA 2354,The Art of Mediation and Negotiation,9/3/2024,12/13/2024,9/3/2024,12/13/2024,1,Susan,Sgorbati,sgorbati@bennington.edu,Advancement of Public Action,On Campus,"This class will examine conflict resolution theory and practice. We will explore the nature of conflict, principled negotiation and the mediation process. The skills of active listening as well as multi-party collaborative problem-solving will be introduced. The class will offer a 24 hour Certificate in Mediation Training. Classes will include readings, discussion and
role-play simulations. Skills in this area are central to understanding conflict interpersonally, in groups, and in complex organizational settings."
APA 2355,Introduction to Restorative Justice,10/22/2024,12/13/2024,10/22/2024,12/13/2024,2,Alisa,Del Tufo,alisadeltufo@bennington.edu,Advancement of Public Action,On Campus,"Restorative Justice is a set of values and practices that are having a considerable impact on the way our justice system, schools, workplaces, conflict zones and communities think about and enact justice. Restorative Justice asks: What if harm doers were given the opportunity to take responsibility and make amends? If survivors were able to be active participants in defining what justice is and how it could be enacted to help them to heal and move on? And if the larger community was involved in this accountability and healing process? It also asks the more elemental question: how can we help people to care more about each other and to heal when harm has been done?

In the current social environment, we are questioning the value and humanity of our current system of “justice”. Given this potential openness to change, it is not enough to say that the American system of punishment does not achieve these goals. Restorative justice claims to provide the structure and philosophy needed to make this transformation to justice more real. But what are the philosophical, psychological, social and emotional values, concepts and practices on which it is built and can be mobilized to support that change? How can we ensure as much as possible that restorative justice is actually restorative and what theory and practices are most valuable in that effort?

This class will expose you to many of the core ideas and practices of restorative justice. It is designed to provide you with understanding of the history, theory and practices of this field. You will learn how to run circles and facilitated dialogues to address conflict and to build community. You will also be offered opportunities to be a part of the campus based Restorative Justice Collaborative."

APA 2357,Sustainable Development Goals,10/22/2024,12/13/2024,10/22/2024,12/13/2024,2,Andrea,Galindo,andreagalindo@bennington.edu,Advancement of Public Action,On Campus,"Sustainable development has been defined as development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. It calls for concerted efforts towards building an inclusive, sustainable, and resilient future for people and planet. For sustainable development to be achieved, it is crucial to harmonize three core elements: economic growth, social inclusion, and environmental protection. These elements are interconnected, and all are crucial for the well-being of individuals and societies.

Eradicating poverty in all its forms and dimensions is an indispensable requirement for sustainable development. To this end, there must be promotion of sustainable, inclusive, and equitable economic growth, creating greater opportunities for all, reducing inequalities, raising basic standards of living, fostering equitable social development and inclusion, and promoting integrated and sustainable management of natural resources and ecosystems.

At their core, the Sustainable Development Goals are a universal call for action to end poverty, protect the planet and improve the lives and prospects of everyone, everywhere. The 17 Goals were adopted by all UN Member States in 2015, as part of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development which set out a 15-year plan to achieve the Goals.
The goals encompass the understanding that ending poverty and other deprivations must go together with strategies that improve health and education, reduce inequality, and spur economic growth — all while tackling climate change and working to preserve our oceans and forests.

Today, progress is being made in many places, but, overall, action to meet the Goals is not yet advancing at the speed or scale required. Ambitious action is needed to deliver the Goals by 2030. With just under ten years left to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals, world leaders at the SDG Summit in September 2019 called for a Decade of Action and delivery for sustainable development, and pledged to mobilize financing, enhance national implementation and strengthen institutions to achieve the Goals by the target date of 2030, leaving no one behind.

More people around the world are living better lives compared to just a decade ago. More people have access to better healthcare, decent work, and education than ever before. But inequalities and climate change are threatening to undo the gains. Investment in inclusive and sustainable economies can unleash significant opportunities for shared prosperity. And the political, technological and financial solutions are within reach. But much greater leadership and rapid, unprecedented changes are needed to align these levers of change with sustainable development objectives."

There are two ways such challenges can be addressed: authoritarianism and democracy. Authoritarians claim that leaders know the answers to all questions and the citizens must obey the leaders – whether general secretary, generalissimo, representative of divine power, or president.  Democrats accept pluralism and peaceful transfer of power, and rely on popular sovereignty,  open debate, compromise, political equality and majority rule to seek answers.

Absolutist perspectives, whether secular or metaphysical, threaten democracy. For a democratic nation can function only if it has a generally accepted (not imposed) set of rules. Today, globalization and technological advance"

We maintain relationships with local organizations and members while developing new ones, along with more conventional classes and readings. Over the past couple of years it has ballooned into a range of simultaneous activities that are seemingly happening all of the time, with students very much at the center of said impetus.
More specifically, we run visits to local farms, interpretation services, ESL classes, Spanish classes, transportation, a variety of social events, and assistance with the DMV. Ganas has also provided support for Sunrise, Neighborhood Connections, Bridges to Health, the Bennington Free Clinic, and is the leader of one multi-college consortium. We have cemented the more political wing of the group, through the Berkshire Immigrant Center, Migrant Justice, and Milk with Dignity, organizing the latter’s protests in the town of Bennington.

The group’s largely student-managed ethos should be emphasized herein.

As it pertains to modern social justice and public action projects, the imperative to incorporate systems of care and healing into the greater conversation has increased dynamically. With the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic and increased environmental issues due to climate change, it has become even more vital to consider holistic care models in this age of perpetual global crisis. But how do we practice care within contemporary community structures? How might we center technologies of rest in the face of calamity? This seminar examines how contemporary creative researchers and activists might consider dramaturgy as a radical care strategy within contemporary culture and public life. Course readings and viewings offer historical and contemporary case studies. We will regularly have in-class writing exercises and viewings to collectively refine our textual and discursive relationships to public action and performance across various genres of liveness and time-based forms. We will practice meditation, rest, and modes of horizontality.

This seminar draws on research methods used in the fields of visual culture and aesthetics, mediation, emergent performance practice, and literature. Creative responses across a variety of media and a final project, in lieu of a final paper, are expected."

– Robert Harbison, Eccentric Spaces

In her lecture How We Narrate Our Yesterday Determines How We Imagine The Future, Mariam Kamara describes the loss of our capacity to read architecture when we subscribe, uncritically, to totalizing histories that are disproportionately concerned with architecture’s appearance rather than the materials, conditions, and interactions that make it. The design theorist Mark Linder cites Minimalism as a point of reentry into “literalness” which he considers to be “architecture’s most salient and salacious effects.” Where might these perspectives intersect? On the one hand, Kamara’s skepticism of the hegemony of the western canon on global architectural production and, on the other, Linder’s sense that a post-war art movement that emerged in the United States might bring us, somehow, closer to something essential about the architectural discipline?

In this course we will practice various operations of the architectural profession—namely: orthographic drawing, model-making, sketching, and documenting to build on our own working definitions of architecture. To anchor our questions, we will survey, study and document an existing building shell. How does it work? How was it built? What makes it stand? What parts of it are failing? We will represent (with drawings) and replicate (with models) this existing structure, and then propose restorations, adaptations, or renovations to what is left of it through our projects."

In addition to getting a grasp of the foundational biology, students will engage with various online databases and resources, becoming familiar with the computational algorithms and methodologies used to mine and analyze the ever-increasing data generated from whole-genome sequencing, and consider how that improves our understanding of evolutionary relationships amongst organisms based on their molecular fingerprints. In the second half of the term, students will work in teams on a genome annotation project, contributing to an ongoing multi-institute analysis of understudied regions of various Drosophila species’ genomes. Students completing successful project work become eligible for future co-author status on emerging publications by the Genomics Education Partnership consortium."

This class is a deep dive into forest ecology, land use change, and forest succession at a local scale. Students will explore the local forest community composition, structure, and function over the last 15,000 years and discuss the environmental conditions, disturbance dynamics, and biotic interactions responsible for the forest we have today. We will assess the current condition of the campus forests, practice plant identification skills, and look for signs of past disturbances to piece together the history of this place. We will use the “layer cake” model to incorporate many tiers including bedrock & surficial geology, topography & hydrology, human culture, plant biology, and climate into our understanding of local forest ecology."

Ecology is a broad field, encompassing research at the scales of individuals, populations, communities, and ecosystems with methods that draw on traditional ecological knowledge, Darwin-esque natural history observations, cutting edge computer modeling, and beyond. In this course, we will survey the concepts and frameworks that underpin ecology research and learn to think quantitatively about populations and communities. Students will explore how ecological interactions produce the patterns and processes observed in biomes around the world, and gain an appreciation for the limitations of modern ecology’s frameworks.

We work to protect endangered species, facilitate the recovery of threatened species, reduce invasive species, and restore historically present species, but we also understand that even absent human pressures, some species are more rare than others. How do ecologists understand what makes some species rare and others common? What impacts do rarity or commonness have on ecosystem structure and function? How do human-caused changes in abundance shift these dynamics? In this class, we will explore questions of rarity and commonness through peer-reviewed papers in ecology and biological conservation. We’ll unpack how scientists have defined and framed rare and common species in papers spanning four decades of research. Finally, we will connect our ecological understandings of “rare” and “common” to conservation policy-making and management."

We will consider many aspects of dance making, embodiment, and performance. We will work towards constantly evolving ways to be one’s own teacher—recognizing patterns, heightening awareness of observation, and selecting easier, more efficient, and effective movement options. Improvisational structures will test and inform our making and moving via screening/reading/composing. We will look at the tools needed for developing and performing our own work and feeling more comfortable in our bodies. Students’ experiments will be regularly drafted, viewed, discussed and edited, opening up conversations about technique, structure, organization, and disorganization (to understand a range of perspectives). In order to expand the process, we will develop some complementary practices of creating through writing, drawing, and storytelling. Collaborative and solo projects will be developed throughout the term and will include a showing in Dance Workshop or in the end-of-term Studio Concert."

This work examines different sections of the skeleton such as the pelvis, legs, spine, and shoulder girdle. We will also address the psoas muscle as the pillar(s) of the body connecting our lower and upper halves.

This work aims to release the joints and increase the space within. This will help for efficiency in different movement techniques, and will also promote organic movement and an exploration of different movement qualities. As a consequence of this practice, we will understand ways to take care of the body, reduce wear, and amplify breathing, all significant health benefits.

This course is intended for students from any discipline who wish to engage with embodiment and an application of anatomical concepts towards movement and creative expression. Students can expect to do some light work outside of class studying anatomical structures as well as physical work in class. No prior dance experience necessary."
DAN 2360,"Accidents, Glitches and Errors/From Content to Form",9/3/2024,12/13/2024,9/3/2024,12/13/2024,1,Elena,Demyanenko,edemyanenko@bennington.edu,Dance,On Campus,"This is a practice for participants of any discipline to activate the desired body, in their chosen form or medium.

Trusting the intrinsic intelligence of the body, as well as discovering the glitches that contribute to the making process, we will source multiple systems (muscular, skeletal, fluid, organ) and other ways of reading the body (energy, emotion, history, trauma). Attunement at the level of reflex, habit, and fundamental technique let us support, reject, help, and preempt decision-making. Throughout the creative process, we will allow what seems to be an error to become useful material.

We investigate escalation and tension using modes that effectively bypass culturally dominant binaries of self and other and offer various approaches to relationships that define and re-define our understanding of power. Ultimately, what lies at the core of our de-centered power play is a non-binary meaning-making.

We will derive form and content from places known through direct experience, drawing on sensation, thought, memory, and imagination. Students’ compositional drafts will be regularly created/viewed and discussed, sparking conversations on structure, organization, and disorganization.

We will develop the results of this research with a view to presenting and performing in studio showings, produced performances, and/or dance workshops."

How can we move with feelings of sadness and melancholy? This class asks the student to practice finding action, even when the body might feel stagnant, leaden, or difficult to motivate.

We will utilize a lot of horizontal positions to build length and strength in our muscles, while trying our best to remain present with all our sensations, including emotions like sadness. This class will begin and end with guided meditations, visualizations, and breathing exercises to attune our consciousness to how we truly feel. The bulk of the class will offer repetitive movements in the style of pilates (though this is not a formal pilates class).

No pilates experience necessary. Sadness at some point in your life is a prerequisite."

In light of the above question, this course will be fully remote, facilitated through a combination of synchronous remote sessions and individual outside-class projects. Throughout the course, with body-centered minds, we will interview each other, and exchange conversations, poems, ideas, songs, drawings and inspirations, sometimes using nonsensical and absurd themes. Using the early-bird special class time (the most pure and non-invasive time of a day!), we will support and inspire each other to set up a healthy, positive and creative mental and physical modality in order to live each day fully as a new once-in-a-life-time event, not as a predetermined routine. In addition, various movement and art practices that activate our body and sensory system will be introduced in each session in order to facilitate the body-centered thinking and communication process.

This course is open to students from any discipline who are interested in exploring an interdisciplinary approach to body-based arts and practice, and cultivating and deepening their own practices and visions while staying in communication with and inspired by others. Students can participate in this course from anywhere remotely. Besides weekly zoom meetings, students will be asked to develop their own small “dances” of any medium inspired by the in-class conversations with others."
DAN 2410,Alexander Technique: Optimizing how you work when moving,9/3/2024,12/13/2024,9/3/2024,12/13/2024,1,Ros,Warby,roswarby@bennington.edu,Dance,On Campus,"This course will introduce and/or deepen students’ understanding of the Alexander Technique and Ideokinesis in relation to dance, the practice of performance, and everyday movement. It is both a movement and somatic class. The Alexander Technique opens up the possibility of finding new balance, efficiency, strength, direction, and perspective. It makes your physical capacity more available, as well as your performative intelligence, and it improves everyday function.

Some classes will include the application of the Alexander Technique and performance practice principles when moving or dancing, and some classes will focus on the study of the skeleton in order to understand the fundamentals of the body. The instructor will guide and support students into a more optimal balance and freedom. Alexander Technique challenges the student to wake up and notice what it is they are doing in their day to day lives and performance work. This shift in awareness and attention aims to stimulate and enhance better function all around."

The class will focus on discussions of the reading and writing materials as well as in-class meditation experience. The goal of this course is to deepen our collective understanding of the intimate connection and complementarity of Buddhist ideas and meditation. The class discussions will encourage both skepticism and open mindedness as we dive deeply into the vast ocean of Buddha’s way. Course activities will include reading Buddhist texts and writing essays that reflect and expand our collective understanding.  There is no prerequisite for this class besides curiosity and a desire to understand what it is all about.

We will explore the history and the effects of colonization in select regions of the world, i.e. Sénégal, Gambia, and other countries in West Africa. We will focus on how specific dance practices intersect with systems of race, ethnicity, and national identity. We will focus further on how dance expresses and intervenes in systems of power and oppression, including nation, race, gender, and class. We will explore how globalization across geographic, political, commercial, and digital domains has shaped the evolution of dance practice, performance, and community. 

Students will read a series of texts, observe video, images, mixtape, and podcasts. We will see how African Dance and American Black Modern Dance are deeply connected. Students will write a few essays/reflections. Throughout, students will share their research and collaborate in building a digital archive of their findings."

We will build an improvisation practice that explores the dynamics between the musicians and dancers as well as how movement and live music can be experienced as a singular, integrated entity.  We will also examine movement and embodied practices of the African diaspora, connecting dance lineages of the past, present, and future.

This will be an integrated studio and sociohistorical academic study in specific African dance techniques. 

We will highlight and acknowledge the significance of stepping, stomping, hand coordination, upper body torsion, and hip mobility."

We will look to scholars, artists, thinkers, and ourselves to process the elliptical paths people take to understand material existence through the relationality of dance. We will try to bring a scope of questioning to regard dance as an artistic practice which illuminates the continuum of time rooted in the lived phenomena of recognizing aliveness as it is lived. By disrupting the colonial eurocentric models of historicity, research, and pedagogy within white supremacist patriarchy, our time together will become a time to figure out ways in which dance and experiential digging (research) can reveal insights into how the form is a distinct compass. The course will consist of meeting collectively for 4 hours each week to collaboratively discuss readings from the prior week, along with assigned viewings and any additional research. This gathering and processing of content through ideas, experiences, discussions, and independent work will include 8 hours of study outside of our classroom each week."

This course explores the malleability of perception within art making. We will engage in collaborative, contemplative, choreographic, emotional, and imaginal practices that empower the “problems” of body, mind, and heart as sources of discovery. Much of the studio time will focus on finding a joyful effort in the body that extends into dance-oriented improvisation and making challenges. Yet artists across all disciplines are welcome and encouraged to share their own magical strategies for transforming lead into gold. Mystical, philosophical, and artist-memoir readings accompany the studio work. In-class dialogue, written reflections, and peer responses consider the global need for all of us to do this work together."

With many performance projects, there is little time to contemplate, rethink or adjust designs in the actual performance space; there is rarely an opportunity to watch a collaborative art develop. In this class, equipped space is available to give the time to seriously look at and question the interrelationship  of visual and kinetic performance elements. Visual choices affect movement and how it is seen and movement choices affect how visual components are used and seen.  We will explore in fine detail what and how the performance elements communicate to viewers, paying particular attention to the manipulation and refinement of composition, focus, timing and transformation.

Furthermore, this situation is an opportunity to explore equal partnership among the collaborators, whose roles will shift. Students are actively involved in all aspects — making movement, designing lighting and designing costumes. No particular technical skills are expected of those enrolling, as the course will focus on conceptualization, design, making work, and collaboration; instruction in any technical skills needed to complete the assignments will be included in the course.

Explorations are structured for both formal theatrical contexts and informal studio situations as well as found environments. Time for group project development must be invested outside of class in the Martha Hill Theater. While some projects are done on an individual basis, most coursework requires close collaboration with other students in the class and close observation of the work of others. All work done for the course is viewed and discussed by the class and instructors as a group. Students interested in any performance related area, visual storytelling, theatrical design, and/or making work collaboratively will benefit from this course."

We know when we can do an estimation of the movement, just to tell if the steps will line up with the meter of a song. We also know when we need to practice with full momentum, otherwise our partner won’t be able to feel our weight shift. Effort Lab is a practice of naming and knowing what it takes to do what you’re doing. No one else might know the effort required, but we always do.

Whether it is high or low effort, calibrating these effort levels is one way we survive capitalist systems while retaining agency and, ideally, cultivating enjoyment. Effort Lab uplifts effort as a compositional tool and design technique, thereby empowering each dancer to exercise their authorship, agency, and invention.

Class will include an embodied check-in and a gentle warm-up. Through improvisatory dancing and writing, we will map out our relationships to effort through demonstrations, dialogue, charts, and maps. We will travel outside the studio to witness how effort shifts environmentally, sometimes voluntarily and sometimes involuntarily.

Effort Lab will have moments of high and low effort in order to ask: What feelings arise when our effort doesn’t match our circumstances? How can we calibrate our effort so that we’re giving an amount that feels right?"

This will encourage a letting go of the attachment we have to engrained movement patterns and preconceived ideas of what our dance vocabulary can/should include. In turn, this will open up the possibility of finding new efficiency, direction, and perspective. The practice of improvisation will expand the students physical, performative and choreographic intelligence.

Certain histories and lineages of dance improvisation practice will be referenced and discussed within class, as well as readings of significant improvisation dance artists in the field, including Lisa Nelson, Deborah Hay, Eva Karczag, Dana Reitz, Steve Paxton and William Forsythe. We will practice solo, duet and group improvisation, navigating our relationship to time, space and our audience."

Dancers working together will inspire each other based on their relationship. As material reveals itself, moment to moment, consider that the dancers will be “teaching” each other as they work. This premise will allow us to learn from one another.

We will also learn how to recognize and detach from what we already know in order to make room for what we don’t know. Learning how to compose while moving is key, making space for each dancer to trust the duet. They must accept what they do not know, in order to wake up to what is there in any given moment. Inhabiting the space we are dancing in, being in relationship to one another, and seeing all there is around us expands our experience. Feedback will be part of our work. How we see and how we can include our audience as part of our dancing is key to how the duets develop. Structures may be developed in multiple ways, using written, spatial, physical, and vocal scores."

This is a self-journey. This course is for students who wish to find their artistic voices by exploring an interdisciplinary approach to making work. Using poetry, visual art, improvisation and various movement practices, we will make a series of projects as individuals, as partners in duets, and as members of ensembles.

This course will support students in choreographic/artistic risk-taking and the development of new performative directions and perspectives. Students will investigate and explore ways of creating dance suitable for a variety of occasions and a broad range of physical and conceptual abilities."

This is a rigorous movement class that focuses on traveling through space, using the spirals embedded in the body and exploring how these will help us to separate from the floor and come back to it. We will create movement sequences and phrases sourced from postmodern dance techniques and Flying Low (movement practice developed by David Zambrano that investigates moving fluidly in and out of the floor).

Starting from simplicity and leading towards complexity, we will gradually explore speed, phrasing, rhythm, spatiality, and expression.

This course is intended for students with previous experience with dance and movement-based practices who wish to deepen their understanding and experience of dynamic movement that relates to gravity and complex movement patterns."

The course challenges students to develop relationships to performance/performative action as research. We will engage practices where seeing and being seen by each other are central, studying the ways in which witnessing one another in process stimulates and deepens learning. Critical Dance Processes: Actions 1 will serve as a space where civic thinking is enacted – where we learn how to re-imagine and re-shape our relationships to the world we live in, where we face urgent questions surrounding how to work together to manifest the futures we desire.

This course is designed to be the culmination of the BFA program for all dance majors. Each student will propose a thesis project, develop goals and objectives for the semester, and present their work. Modes of practicing, situating and expressing thesis project research will be mobilized and extended through ongoing critical dialogue. We will attend to, in practice, the urgent questions facing our lives and the field of dance and performance. 

This course culminates in the public sharing of a thesis project and supports work emerging from research in and through the study of dance; projects can take many forms – coming to fruition as a dance/performance event, a film/video, a podcast, a series of texts, a workshop, etc. Thesis projects will move through critical processes of experimental making and collective feedback in preparation for public presentation. Writing will be positioned as a vital practice embedded within processes of research, creation and sharing of works. Throughout the semester, each student will develop virtual platforms/websites that will function as spaces to organize and share out research practices, writing and documentation of thesis projects."

The expression of polyrhythms through House Music, Afrobeat, Afro Jazz and traditional West African sonics act as a compass toward the manipulation of rhythm. Writing + improvisation will be tools we use to wander through the voicing of movement through the poetics.  

Afternoon and evening sessions will travel through the histories of Afro + Black sound artists, song + poetry writing techniques & sampling in Hip-Hop. Through the examination of process, this class uses examples of Djing, Sampling, choreography and writing to highlight useful ways to archive sounds, and generate new ideas.

Classes begin with mindful walking, rolling, and flow pattern practices followed by “yes dance” improvisations to gather our attention and set a tone of tender touch. From there, we progress through a series of spiraling sequences that establish a buoyant relationship with the floor, harness forces of momentum, and demand intricate expressions of the limbs. Interplay with music offers an exchange of texture, rhythmic challenge, and nuance. For several “making days,” you will often be asked to work in collaboration with classmates to develop dances that both honor and challenge your personal voices. Sequences from class eventually combine into dynamic phrases. We take time to perform for each other in solos, duets, and small groups. 

Jenkins: This class aims to maximize each student’s movement possibilities in a safe, yet rigorous container. We will hone our kinesthetic awareness particularly focusing on the perception of weight and gravity in movement. Class begins with floor work, drawing from meditation, yoga, somatic practices, and Laban/Bartenieff developmental movement principles. We will set a tone of comfort and wakeful sensitivity as we find ‘floors’ of support in the body, space, and sonic environment. Using set and improvised center and traveling exercises, class will progress into movement ideas that attend to weight and momentum shifts, dynamic stability, specific body part initiations, resiliency, rebound, and sequential thinking. We will further these investigations in detailed phrase work that will build throughout the semester.

Jenkins: This class aims to maximize each student’s movement possibilities in a safe, yet rigorous container. We will hone our kinesthetic awareness particularly focusing on the perception of weight and gravity in movement.

We will further these investigations in detailed phrase work that will build throughout the semester.

Butler: Course sessions are playfully geared towards kinetic + intuitive investigation while sharpening useful tools to deepen a multifaceted approach to an artistic experience. Classes begin with guided imagery, exploring both fluid and stabilizing exercises to inform various structures in the body. Sessions then flows into dynamic phrasing that encompasses improvisational tasks, floor work, detailed gesturing, musicality, and more.

Phrase-work will be shared as a portal to play. Choreographed material will act as a set of coordinates that anchor an exploration of exaggeration and sensation. We’ll fall into and out of lush, decadent movement experiences.

Afternoon/evening sessions will be organized as a series of durational practices and collectively designed rituals of exquisite attention; we will focus on creating immediate and urgent opportunities for dancing, drawing and writing. Spectacularly fleeting events, or micro-theaters, will be designed and inhabited each session. We’ll accumulate the artifacts of our research – drawings, notes, animations, scores – ultimately co-conspiring on how we might catalog and/or share the manifestations of our work.

Students in this course will be encouraged to investigate in and through movement the “possibilities of the imagination.”  

Haworth:  This is a Contemporary Modern Technique class that has been influenced by Ideokinesis, Alexander and Klein techniques. The work dives into Personal-Genius, refining technique while maximizing artistic expression. Class begins with self-care and a somatic based warm up, lubricating joints and stretching muscles. Floor improvisation and Bartenieff Inspired Fundamentals instill skills and ready the body for open dancing. The middle section has a yoga stretch that has been influenced by somatic and alignment work. Center work focuses on: foot, back, and leg exercises before diving into handstands. The work emphasizes a fluid spine and grounded weight while highlighting specificity of initiation, alignment and releasing into space. The class builds dynamically from subtle exercises into large athletic phrases that move in and out of the floor, on the hands, and through space with easy exciting sequential momentum.

Classes begin with mindful walking, rolling, and flow pattern practices followed by “yes dance” improvisations to gather our attention and set a tone of tender touch. From there, we progress through a series of spiraling sequences that establish a buoyant relationship with the floor, harness forces of momentum, and demand intricate expressions of the limbs. Interplay with music offers an exchange of texture, rhythmic challenge, and nuance. For several “making days,” you will often be asked to work in collaboration with classmates to develop dances that both honor and challenge your personal voices.

Particular attention will be paid to how computer models relate to specific measurements, spaces, context, and future outputs. This course is aimed at building technical skills but will also consider aesthetics, functionality, and design concepts. Its ultimate goal is a feedback loop between conceptual development, workflow, and the generation of 3D Models. This course will culminate in a final portfolio of digital 3D model renderings and will serve as a prerequisite for the class Processing and Making with Rhino 7."

It might signify tools for what Achille Mbembe calls “the frenzied codification of social life according to…various categories of abstraction that claim to rationalize the world on the basis of corporate logic.” Pier Vittorio Aureli observes the emergence of the English word In the late sixteenth-century to describe “something more general than the graphic aspect of drawing (dessin)” and how the Italian disegno became “an ideological banner of a new class of practitioners eager to distinguish themselves from artisans.” In this introductory course, we will grapple with the changing meaning of the word, and the discipline, through practice. We will contend with the separation of (or impossibility of separating) manual and intellectual work. As we plan, project, and translate ideas into drawings, objects, and other things, we will ask ourselves when the impulse to measure, order, classify, and categorize turns compulsive."

— Erwin Panofsky, Perspective as Symbolic Form

This course is about how an image might represent a codified or systematic way of thinking. We will study the differences between one-point perspective, parallel projection, non-perspectival representation, and the problem of depth in these representational modes. Weekly drawing exercises will be paired with readings to elaborate on various ‘rules’ for creating space in a picture. After a series of directed drawing assignments, students will work individually to further explore, untangle, or build on the drawing methods studied in the course. Students will have the option of making original work, creating perspectival experiments, or conducting and presenting research for their final projects. Massimo Scolari’s book (after which the course is titled) will be used as a reader, and we will consider Anne Anlin Cheng’s proposition that “We do not master by seeing; we are ourselves altered when we look.”"

We will experience the dynamic pageant of theater history through an exploration of its conventions and aesthetics, as well as its social and cultural functions. We will study theater history from antiquity through the nineteenth century, reading representative plays ranging from Greek tragedy and classical Sanskrit drama; to an array of Japanese theatrical forms (Noh, Bunraku, and Kabuki); and through German Romanticism and American melodrama. Along the way, we will read key critical and theoretical texts illuminating the plays. The course encompasses not only the study of plays as dramatic texts, but also their contexts of theater architecture and stagecraft, performance conventions, debates of art and commerce, shifting relationships to the audience, and questions about expanding the canon. Through an interdisciplinary study of theater history, students will also learn to connect theatrical tradition to its contemporary practice."

Through readings, discussions, and projects students will learn the basic skills of stage management: scheduling, technical breakdowns, blocking notation, understanding design drawings, managing rehearsals, creating a prompt book, calling cues, and running a show.  Special attention will be paid to communication and collaboration, as well as the stage manager’s unique ability to influence the culture of a production in terms of ethics, equity, and inclusion.

In this course, we will explore how these concepts, originally deeply rooted in theatrical practice, have evolved into a considerably broader paradigm. We will consider how the concerns of scenography, such as dramaturgy, spatial composition and focus, and most essentially visual storytelling, can inform the making or viewing of work beyond the boundaries of theater spaces, in situations ranging from public art and spectacle to politics."

Three groups of students are eligible to apply for Advanced Dramaturgy: 1) students who have previously taken Introduction to Dramaturgy and will be working on a Drama-supported production or independent project for Fall 2024; 2) students who have previously taken Introduction to Dramaturgy; 3) students who have not taken Introduction to Dramaturgy, but who will be working on a Drama-supported production or independent project for Fall 2024.

For students in these first and third groups, it is not necessary to work in the role of production dramaturg on a show; actors, directors, playwrights, and designers who envision a substantive research and/or analytical component to their production work are also encouraged to apply.

Students will participate in weekly workshop discussions about their dramaturgy projects. Students will also be responsible for assignments, including research exercises and short essays on genre, style, and structure, that contribute to a final research casebook on a play or musical. For students working as dramaturgs on productions, rehearsal hours will be considered in distribution of workload each week.

The heroine has to take the full course of cancer treatments. The polar vortex is coming.  The iceberg is waiting for its date with the Titanic. They say that the main character of every story is time. In timebound art forms, there are two times running in parallel: the story’s, and the audience’s.

Almost all works for the stage and screen begin at a moment when something is about to happen. Some characters want it to happen, others do not.  But regardless of a character’s hopes or fears, a fuse has been timed and measured and lit.  And when it burns down, the play or movie is over.

Each work’s fuse is a clock that belongs to the story of the piece, where it controls and motivates actions and events.  A strong clock counts down the when of the characters’ desires, it counts down how long they will be given to struggle to get them, it counts down the meaning of too late.   But its greatest utility is that it shapes the audience’s attention.  It organizes an audience’s hopes and fears. Who would get excited watching Cinderella stroll home leisurely after the ball?  The clock is going to strike twelve, and the spectator is desperate for her to make it home before it does.

We will look at fairy tales, plays, films, and streaming series to investigate their use of time as an organizing principle, focusing on the way that an audience’s hopes are manipulated by urgency for greatest effect, and the way to craft the nextness that drives an audience most effectively.  Works will include Arrival, An Octoroon, The Clean House, Back to the Future, Betrayal, Memento, Groundhog Day, The Piano Lesson, 24, a football game, and a selection of action films.

Short writing assignments and critical papers will be required for each work we view or read, and a final play of 30-90 minutes will be required."

Depending on skill level and confidence, students will be assigned a period from the Victorians from which the student will choose a Historical Garment to copy/adapt/re-design and fully build.

Described as the second most frequently produced playwright in the world after William Shakespeare, Henrik Ibsen continues to provoke, challenge and inspire contemporary audiences with the contradictions in his work. This course explores Ibsen’s immense influence and innovations as an architect of modern drama. The Norwegian playwright restlessly experimented with the theatrical genre while relentlessly pursuing themes of personal freedom. From early works such as Brand to his final play When We Dead Awaken, Ibsen’s plays urge the individual’s imperative toward moral autonomy and the challenging of repressive societal institutions: whether marriage, the church, or the corruption of a free press. As Ivo de Figueiredo observes, “Ibsen captured his own times with astonishing power,” even as his works, written between 1850 and 1899, have inspired a diverse array of twentieth and twenty-first century playwrights and adaptors, ranging from Owen Dodson and Charles Ludlam, to Branden Jacobs-Jenkins, Amy Herzog, and Charles Busch. Setting Ibsen’s plays in contexts of nineteenth-century Romantic nationalism, the dawn of continental Realist and Naturalist movements, and the rise of the “New Woman,” this course will span Ibsen’s epic verse dramas (e.g. Peer Gynt); his social and feminist problem plays (e.g. A Doll’s House, Hedda Gabler, An Enemy of the People); and his theatrical explorations into subconscious drives (e.g. The Master Builder) in late works that influenced new movements of Symbolism and Expressionism, and paralleled the dream-plays of August Strindberg, Ibsen’s peer and rival in Sweden."

In this class we’re going to take a look at what a hero is and what it means to write and sing the songs that immortalize them. And by songs I mean…plays and movies. We will attempt to define what a hero is, what a hero was, what a hero could be. We will look at the everyman hero, the superhero (formerly known as a demigod), and everything in between. Primarily we’re going to examine the ordinary person who, in the heat of war or the great pressures caused by the unfairness of life, says this far, no further. I will stand up no matter what the cost.

There are hundreds of heroes we could look at, but we’ll be most interested in examining those enshrined in works that help create a society’s shared moral compass. We’ll be reading and watching the stories of modern moments of courage in the face of great risk, both true life examples and fictional ones: Schindler’s List, Hotel Rwanda, Till, Casablanca, A Small Light, To Kill a Mockingbird, Ruined. We’ll look at people who stepped in to save others when no one else would: Erin Brockovich, Oslo. And we’ll talk about the courageous who haven’t been sung about in our artform yet. Maybe you’ll do the singing. Malala Yousafzai, who won the Nobel Peace Prize for fighting for rights for women and who was shot by the Taliban for it, Brad Raffensperger, the Georgia Secretary of State who stood up to Trump and wouldn’t let him steal the Georgia election, Gloria Steinem and Betty Friedan, who worked tirelessly, fighting for equal rights for American women, the list goes on and on. We’ll also spend some time contemplating everyday superpowers like money, beauty, strength, community, family, nepotism. And the all-time winner: charm, or charisma, the power to make people do what you want, to believe what you want them to believe. This makes our artform a superpower, and once in a great while, when changing the hearts and minds of its audience (Angels in America, The Vagina Monologues) one capable of the heroic.

In this course, we will rehearse and perform a production of Anton Chekhov’s The Cherry Orchard. Our approach will be fully actor-driven, and ensemble based with minimal design elements. Our focus will be on bringing the characters wholly to life, both physically and emotionally in a rehearsal process dedicated to imagining and creating the world of the play. We will seek to find the strongest, most action filled dynamics in the relationships between characters. Rehearsals will take place in class with an additional one night a week for the first half of the term. Possible additional rehearsals will be scheduled as needed towards the end of the term in consultation with the ensemble, with performances at the end of the term.

Working primarily with the human figure, students build increased understanding of the poetic, dynamic, and inherently abstract nature of drawing, while paying close attention to the potential of formal elements such as shape, line, form, and the creation of pictorial space. Although each class period provides structures and activities within which students work, the ultimate aim of this class to allow students the time and space necessary to further develop their drawing skills so as to best support individual projects and concerns. Class time is divided between drawing from life, discussing student work, and examining the use of the figure in visual art, using both contemporary and historical examples. Please note that this course may require additional materials to be purchased by the student.

Note: Much of this class will be spent drawing the nude human form."

How does one sustain a meaningful, vital, creative inquiry? How can a direct connection be made between daily life and making images, and between the personal, and public or political worlds?

This intermediate level course will address these questions through an intensive immersion in drawing and investigation into the design of strategies for generating imagery. Students will be asked engage with a series of structures, arrangements, and approaches to visual thinking. These frameworks, or conditions, will be found in the world, and also designed by students themselves, both through individual activity and through collaboration. Examinations of the ideas, artworks, and approaches used by artists from history and contemporary art will provide a platform on which investigations will be based.

A high level of commitment is expected; students will engage with assignments which will require them to draw daily, to focus fully on the development of an ambitious drawing practice, and to dedicate themselves to strengthening their skills and awareness of their own narrative priorities as artists. Students should expect regular reading, writing, and assigned research.

Although students will be asked to respond to questions presented in class, and specific assignments will be given throughout this course, it is the objective of this class to provide the skills necessary for the student to confidently pursue self-designed projects."

Through the amalgamation of art, craft, music, and performance, Gesamtkunstwerk evokes a realm distinct from our everyday experience.

In this course, we will explore the concept of Gesamtkunstwerk by examining historical instances such as the Arts and Crafts Movement in England, the Vienna Secession, Andy Warhol’s Factory, Yayoi Kusama’s work, and Noah Purifoy’s Outdoor Desert Art Museum. Additionally, we will delve into the trend of auteurs and impresarios increasingly dictating artistic terms, which leaned towards authoritarianism before World War II and shifted towards marketing and branding thereafter.

Finally, we will engage in both individual and collaborative studio projects with the aim of creating our own Gesamtkunstwerk as the culminating project of the course."

While applicable to college, they’ll mostly be of the K-12 variety. Proleptically, it should always already recognize the false dichotomy rather too neatly encapsulated in its subtitle.

On the one hand, yes, weekly, we’ll scour the history of education, the issues most pertinent to it, its possibly reified institutions, rationales, epistemologies, (mis)conceptions, and tactics, across a range of disciplines, asking difficult, consequential questions about authority, ownership, management, change, diversity, freedom, individualism, knowledge and power. We may learn a thing or two. As a former graduate of Bennington’s BA/MAT program once put it, perhaps a little more sanguinely, “Given my past experiences working in schools, I knew that I could not simply rely on my philosophies to carry me through, but I knew that in moments of doubt and exhaustion, these positive and energetic ideals could act as safe places to return to and recuperate” (2013).
On the other hand, to begin our process of conflation of ideas and reality from the beginning, in this description, yes, weekly, we’ll put said theories to the test, designing our own lessons and “teaching” each other, while asking similar, difficult, consequential questions about what we are teaching and why, if now using other, palimpsestic vocabulary, such as planning, objectives, understandings, skills, scaffolding, improvisation, advocacy, colleagueship, technology, differentiated strategies, or informal and formal assessment, on a quest for epiphanic moments that make everything else feel trivial. In reflecting on the best of our praxis, we may even learn a different thing or two, or the same things, but differently."

Importantly, it’s not simply an educator’s job to drum up excitement in her students, but students as well must actively contribute to the construction of an active and engaging classroom. What, then, is required of us when we “teach to transgress”? How might we take into context as well social and economic barriers to learning?

This richly interactive course will prime students to engage with how academic material is taught, moving beyond simply the content of what is taught. They will explore how a transgressive classroom might be constructed, and how they––as educators-in-training––might develop the tools to do so.

Students should be committed not just to critical reading and writing, but to gaining experience teaching lessons of their own design to their peers throughout the semester, whereupon they will receive critical feedback and develop alternate ways forward."

Of particular interest will be works produced in an independent/alternative context, in conversation with “trashy” phenomena in broader culture.  This course will conclude with a final work of the student’s choice – whether it take the form of writing, art, or otherwise, it should engage with the theme of this course.

Central to this course is the way “trashy” can be a cultural denigration turned on its head: used by historically marginalized artists and communities to celebrate qualities in any combination: anti-aspirational, queer, counterfeit, filthy, punk and provisional.  Through looking at self-financed works and self-organized collaborations, we’ll pay particular attention to a “trashy” approach to materials: substandard goods, dumpster and ruin diving, and the sharing of scant resources.  We’ll also take a look at art and philosophical writings on proximate ideas of camp, body horror, drag, gore capitalism, maximalism, glitch, abjection, discards, finding beauty in the provisional.

We will explore moving image works that explore these questions, and dive into the technical aspects of sound and image production and post-production that underline them. We will look at how ideas of place and formal innovations are implemented in mainstream narrative, non-narrative, and experimental work, and how filmmakers and moving image artists employ different forms of presentation in the cinema, art galleries, and public spaces.

The Italian author Elena Ferrante wrote their story in the novel My Brilliant Friend and the three volumes that followed. In this year-long course, as we watch the first season of HBO’s My Brilliant Friend, we will ask some enduring questions about friendship: Who is my friend? Why does Jacques Derrida write that your beloved friend is, in theory, also your enemy? Why does the philosopher Adriana Cavarero say that unless a friend writes or tells my story, my story can’t be told as such? Why does the Gospel invite me to love my enemy?    

Over the course of two semesters, students will create a piece of original work for their best friend, whether this human exists or needs to be invented. Your work can be a long letter, a painting, an original music composition, an object you craft, or some research you do for them to help them discover something you think they need to know. Any work you create will be accompanied by a presentation that explains and justifies it, and fulfills specific requirements, the most important of which is: What questions have brought you to this work?

In this course, the students will learn and practice the basics of textual and film analysis. As they refine their critical analysis skills, they will engage in the process of separating what they like or dislike from what they understand, connect, evaluate, and intellectually and emotionally combine to form new knowledge.

Now, the liminal also applies to places, identities, natural events, and historical periods. We will visit sites on campus to discover liminal places and make a creative map of campus. We will use the library to research liminality. We will read short texts about liminality from various and diverse perspectives. Course materials and assignments will include readings of short stories, memoirs, poems, and essays. You will also attend relevant readings, performances, or talks on campus. For the final project, the class will create and edit a digital magazine of their favorite, revised, and polished writing. This FYF in Writing will allow students to practice the five Capacities at Bennington College: inquiry, communication, engage, research, and create.

Each week we will discuss one function of music (in love and war, medicine, spreading news, education, marking status, protest, burying the dead and soothing ghosts, calling cattle and communing with the natural world, insulting rivals, celebration, forming social bonds, raising children, propaganda, law, speaking with gods, spirits and demons, shaming jerks, and so on) with repertoire drawn from all over the world.

Over the course of two terms, we will build a musical vocabulary with which to describe the music and sounds that we hear with greater precision and nuance. Class sessions will often involve periods of listening to recordings and watching video examples. We will go on soundwalks, do deep listening exercises, attend concerts, and listen to relevant talks on campus. Occasionally, we’ll be joined by guests from the college and the wider musical and scholarly community to further enhance our work in the course. Students will write short reflections and blog posts on the practices we are exploring and try to understand their role within a particular socio-cultural environment. There will be occasional presentations and opportunities for students to share their favorite music with the class. For the final project, each student will complete a piece of creative work: an attempt to imagine a use for music and listening in our own lives— a musically enhanced essay, a composition, multimedia artwork, annotated playlist, or something else that deals with an issue, triumph, concern, or problem that we experience in our everyday life. 

This course is structured so that a student without a previous musical background can be successful in it. For example, although music notation is explained, you do not need to be able to read music to complete the course. Course requirements will include: consistent attendance, a willingness to participate actively in class, the final creative project, and a final First Year Forum reflection essay. Most of all, students should come to this course with an open mind and a desire to listen to music and sound with intention and creativity.

Through a series of provocative yet relatively brief readings, we will ponder epistemologies, representation, authority, individualism, alterity, and the specific notion of institutional control while paradoxically developing an informed, disciplined, at least somewhat independent educational practice. Short responses to some of the readings, a few reflections on tactics, and a project in which you’ll teach us all something we didn’t know may prove useful in presenting a shared ideological, heuristic foundation for self-recognition, problem-solving, risk-taking, and colleagueship.

We will investigate commonly used terms, such as “gaslighting” and “neoliberalism” to explore whether they mean what the users of the terms seem to think they mean. We will also consider the words we choose to define who we are and how we want to be seen, the words out of which we assemble our identity. Due to its conflation of Latin and Anglo-Saxon vocabulary, English is a word-rich language, full of nuanced near-synonyms, so we have a lot of choices. What choices do we make with our language as we seek to notice, describe, assert, and persuade? In our yearlong journey, we will research the history of letters of the alphabet and symbols we commonly use in our writing like ampersands and punctuation, consider the history of the English language as we research etymologies and fluctuations in pronunciation and connotation, discuss the impacts of our names on our identities, and engage in wordplay. We will also attempt to write dialogue and flash fictions and speeches, and also devote some attention to the reading and writing of poems, those mysterious constructions of language that the poet William Carlos Williams called “small (or large) machines made out of words.”

This course will allow students to reflect on this kaleidoscopic representation of a society to craft their own understanding of their experience of community at Bennington.
Through filmic and textual analysis, faculty/staff/student/visitor interviews, archive research, and class discussions, students will first develop a critical understanding of the term “community”. Questions such as “To what extent does the community shape who I am?”, “Is time more important than space in the shaping of our community?”, “How does a sense of community affect learning and living together?”. Students will share reaction posts, short essays, and explore film studies, philosophy, literature, languages, history, and other disciplines to explore the questions that arise. They will then design a common representation of their own inquiries and perspectives  in the context of their Bennington education. Although we will delve into questions of multiculturalism and language, no knowledge of French is necessary.

Technology such as Google Earth and Street View has allowed us to virtually explore various places in the world and learn about the history, art, culture, cuisine, etc. of those places.

In this introductory Japanese course, students will virtually explore both historical and modern cities in Japan with Google Earth and Street View and examine the uniqueness of Japanese regions and how traditional and modern culture coexist in the regions while they practice and build their linguistic skills (listening, speaking, reading, and writing) in Japanese. Through this course, students will design a virtual tour to Japan and create their ideal travel plan to Japan. Japanese writing systems – Hiragana, Katakana, and Kanji – will be introduced.

In this course students will learn and examine Japan’s drastic social changes during the Edo period and the Meiji period to investigate what equality and equity meant to Japanese people. During the Edo Period (1603-1868), Japan closed its doors to other countries for about two hundred fifty years, and this isolation helped Japan develop its own unique culture. It, however, ended in 1867 when Japanese culture was introduced to the Western world at an International Exposition in Paris. On the contrary to the Edo period, the next era, Meiji, brought rapid modernization to Japanese society. What caused Japan to close its doors to other countries in the Edo Period? Was there a social hierarchy that existed in Japan? If so, how was it organized? What was happening in Japan during the isolation period? What caused Japanese leaders to change their minds to reopen the country? How were the ideas of equality and equality perceived by Japanese society during those periods? What can modern Japanese and US societies learn from Japan’s social changes during the Edo and the Meiji periods?

In this course, students not only will practice linguistic skills, but also will obtain a deeper understanding of equality and equity through the examination of Japanese history and society. Students will seek the answers to the questions above by studying the historical events of the Edo Period (1603-1868) and the Meiji Period (1868-1912) through the examinations of various Japanese arts such as paintings, pictures, and VR video clips."

Rakugo is one of the traditional Japanese art and storytelling entertainment which became extremely popular during the Edo period (1603-1868). Rakugo is a rather unique storytelling performance because a storyteller sits on a seat on the stage called “kooza” and tells humorous stories without standing up from the seat. Moreover, the storytellers narrate and play various characters by changing their voice, pitch, tone, facial expressions, physical movements, etc.

In this course students will 1) research the history and the essential elements of rakugo, 2) examine several rakugo scripts to learn new grammar points and kanji characters, and 3) analyze how speech patterns change based on age, social status, gender, occasions, and situations.

As they learn about Japanese art, they will analyze elements of Japanese aesthetics that were shared in various art forms during each period. Students will also examine what societal changes influenced the changes in art. There are numerous points in the long Japanese history where the styles of Japanese art changed drastically and/or new art forms arose because of what was happening in Japan during that time. Throughout the course, students will create their own digital art archive to demonstrate their understanding of art history in Japan and why and how new art forms/movements arose in Japan and were brought to Japan.

Students will continue to develop their linguistic and cognitive skills by investigating and researching answers to questions like:
1) How did styles of pottery change when rice agriculture was brought to Japan from China?
2) How did Japanese isolation from foreign countries during the Edo period bring changes to Japanese paintings?
3) How did Buddhism influence Japanese art?"

We will examine linguistic structures used to convey spatial information in languages across the globe (consider English words like ‘left,’ ‘north,’ ‘down,’ or ‘inside’), the evidence for the cognitive processes that are involved in the use of this spatial language, and the cultural variation therein. By studying the language used to situate objects in space, categorize landscape features, and name places, we will gain an understanding of how language might shape our perception of space and how spatial cognition may influence linguistic expression."

And what’s more, desire in and of itself is not reckless.

And yet!

Every good story turns on a character’s desire gone reckless: Gatsby’s desire for Daisy; Terabithia’s desire for a bridge (to be fair, I haven’t read that book, so I might be misrepresenting it’s content); Odysseus’s desire to be cleverer than everyone else (I know, “cleverer” instead of “more clever”?

These texts will be pulled from authors writing in the 19th and early 20th centuries as well as producing work in the here and now, or at least the recently then and soon to be. We’ll focus on how authors employ social mores and specific circumstances to heighten the recklessness of these desires, what historical context and society’s criteria can tell us about how these desires were perceived and, in some cases, punished, and whether and how these desires continue to be transgressive or not. The tentative reading list includes, but is not limited to (nor guaranteeing) Madame Bovary by Flaubert, Lady Chatterly’s Lover by Lawrence, The Vegetarian by Han Kang, My Education by Susan Choi, and Paul Takes the Form of a Mortal Girl by Andrea Lawlor. Students in class will be asked to write critically and fully participate in class discussions as well as complete a final project."

White supremacy is written into every layer of life, an escapable aspect of the modern condition. This hopelessness, though, is just the beginning for the Afropessimist, who nonetheless plots out a radical course forward–– Could pessimism be the real path to freedom? Through a deep reading of Frank B. Wilderson III, Saidyah Hartman, Jared Sexton, and others, we will mine the generative possibilities of this so-called “pessimism” about the Black condition. Students should expect about 40-60 pages of critical/theoretical reading per week, along with a handful of critical response papers."

Exploring ideas of the human and humanity developed across the world at this period, we pursue the idea that forms of difference such as race, gender, and sexuality became essential to defining “human” and “humanity.” Indeed our contemporary world grapples with this legacy. We ask: who is allowed to be fully human? What are the contours of humanity? What sorts of behaviors and ways of thinking must we learn to be fully human?

The course is divided into two units, the first on European colonialism, and the second on Persian imperialism. Juxtaposing colonialism and imperialism allows us to understand the intricacies of how power works, and how forms of difference are made. Colonialism is a form of imperialism; it mechanizes imperialism to make it work more efficiently. Our work is not to make generalizations but to pay close attention to how race, gender, and sexuality shift along axes of time and geography—and also to track when and how certain structures remain intact. In short, nineteenth-century Europe is not the same as twentieth-century Euro-America is not the same as twentieth-century Iran. And yet there is a genealogy here: each one borrows from those before, and concurrent to it."

We will devote ourselves to closely reading novels, short stories, poems, and plays that explore modern African lives, both as they exist in relation to and imagine futures beyond the cruel legacies of genocide, apartheid, and (neo)colonialism. In the pages we read, you will find woven tales of national and personal liberations; intimate portraits of township life, full of grief, grit, and humor; family sagas unfolding across landscapes touched by drought and fraught with the memory of genocide; and glimpses into the ambitions and anxieties of emerging African intellectuals, who feel acutely the many hopes pinned to their futures. From exciting emerging voices to Nobel laureates, writers whose works we may cover include Wole Soyinka, Veronique Tadjo, Rémy Ngamije, Tayeb Salih, Chinua Achebe, Panashe Chigumazi, David Diop, Magogodi Oamphela Makhene, Akwaeke Amezi, Keith Vries, NoViolet Bulawayo, and Njabulo Ndebele."

Seale’s annotated edition makes de- orientalizing gestures while also mapping many of the instances in which this corpus of stories has inspired other works of art and literature.

’Alf Laylah wa-Laylah, known in English as the Thousand and One Nights or the Arabian Nights Tales, is a fascinating work that models nesting frame narratives and plumbs ethical questions related to literature (the Shahrazadian question: can story reform the femicidal king?). It also has a fascinatingly messy history of translation and adaptatation. For some of it’s stories, there are scholarly questions around whether it’s a classical Arabic tale or later French insertion? Is it an archetypal instance of orientalism or a more complicated instance of what Mary Louise Pratt calls a contact zone?

To answer questions around classical Arabic literature and the religious content of the text, we’ll look at work by Robert Irwin. We’ll dive into Edward Said’s Orientalism, and consider Jalal Toufic’s text The Withdrawal of Tradition Past a Surpassing Disaster, in which he considers why Western writers feel such license to adapt from the Nights and why it feels withdrawn from circulation to Toufic as an Arab writer."

Primary readings will include Sor Juana Inés de la Cruz (1648-1695), writer, nun, and polymath in colonial Mexico and poet Eileen Myles (1949- ), who wrote a play inspired by her life; Margery Kempe (1373-1438) and Margery Kempe by Robert Glück (1947- ); and Hildegard von Bingen (1098-1179) and Unknown Language by Huw Lemmey using language from Hildegard of Bingen’s work. We’ll supplement these primary readings with work situating these authors in their religious and cultural contexts, as well including relevant music and visual art.

Writing for the class will include short weekly reading responses, culminating in either a final essay examining one of these dyads or a critical/creative response which will include a short analysis of howone of these contemporary authors worked with their source text and a creative experiment using this author’s methods but with another source text."

Students will also be introduced to the vocabulary and practice of traditional prosody, acquire a familiarity with writing in meter and using rhyme, and attempt traditional forms such as the sonnet, the villanelle, the sestina, the pantoum, the ghazal, and the abecedarian. Particular attention will be paid to the evolution of traditional forms and the myriad ways contemporary poets approach form and prosody. Poets whose work will be discussed will likely include Agha Shahid Ali, Rick Barot, Reginald Dwayne Betts, Jericho Brown, Terrance Hayes, Randall Mann, Maggie Millner, and Mark Strand. Each week, students will read a packet of poems (or volume of poetry) in a given genre, and will attempt a poem in the genre or form being discussed.

Shakespeare invented his own style of the sonnet, originally popularized by Petrarch in the 14th century. In the 154 sonnets published in 1609, Shakespeare dazzles us with his lexical, semantic, aural, syntactic, and rhetorical virtuosity. Nevertheless, he was not immune to a bad romance. As we expand our understanding of Shakespeare’s persistent themes, narrative strategies, ekphrastic innovations, and poetic techniques, we will examine the critical reception of these works, including biographical, Feminist, Queer Theory, and Post-structural approaches. Our most pressing objective is to become more agile, precise, and imaginative close readers of—and writers about—Shakespeare’s poetry."

This 4-credit class will explore autotheory, first-person cultural criticism, and other critical writing with a distinctly personal bent. What does it mean to perform criticism from a subjective standpoint? How do our personal histories inform our critical practice, and how are we (as writers and as people) shaped by the process of critique? As part of our inquiry, we will explore how queer and trans writers like Nelson and Paul Preciado have taken up autotheory and delve into the history of first-person theorizing as a Black feminist practice, from Sojourner Truth to bell hooks. Students will read, analyze, and discuss several essays per week and write 3-4 critical-creative response papers.

We welcome entirely hybrid-form manuscripts, but mixed collections, i.e. some poems with some prose, are not acceptable in this class, for we privilege extended immersion in a single genre. Think of your work as having two, equally important parts: The steady development and drafting of your own project; and sustained engagement with the work of your peers. Our aim is to create a community that is at once rigorous and supportive. To that end, you’ll not only read each other’s drafts but also delve into some of the sources that have inspired, expand and complicate their project. You will also meet regularly with me. Students are expected to work seriously on their manuscripts over the summer and to begin the term with pages ready to be shared. Work begun in a previous course may be continued with the understanding that there will be significant expansion and revision.

Through reading works such as When You Learn the Alphabet and Fruit Punch by Kendra Allen, Heart Berries by Terese Maire Mailhot, What About the Rest of Your Life by Sung Yim, The Boys of My Youth by Jo Ann Beard, The Chronology of Water by Lidia Yuknavitch, and If You Knew Then What I Know Now by Ryan Van Meter, we will examine the underpinnings of childhood, its joys and traumas all, and how these play out in essayistic and memoiristic texts. Paying particular attention to form and style, students will write their own nonfictions that are introspective and investigative, and provide, as these authors do, an existential or theoretical approach to dismantling or assembling their childhoods in light of one’s present considerations."

Go figure. While there, we’ll revisit the ancient myths of horrifying abuse suffered by ancient Greek women at the hands of gods and demi-gods in Ovid’s Metamorphoses, because it is useful to pair everything with a stark and tragic reminder of the transformational resilience of the least powerful among us when suffering trauma.

Aquinas uses a term which seems to be inexact. It baffled me for a long time. It would lead you to believe that he had in mind symbolism or idealism, the supreme quality of beauty being a light from some other world, the idea of which the matter is but the shadow, the reality of which it is but the symbol. I thought he might mean that CLARITAS is the artistic discovery and representation of the divine purpose in anything or a force of generalization which would make the esthetic image a universal one, make it outshine its proper conditions. But that is literary talk. I understand it so.” But is it, really, mere “literary talk?” Such will be the subject of our investigations as we inhabit the worlds of Dubliners, A Portrait of an Artist as a Young Man, and Ulysses. Ancillary readings and investigations will include St. Thomas Aquinas, critical essays, portions of pre-Socratic philosophical texts, religious texts, as well as historical and cultural considerations of the verge of Modernity alongside the plight and lives of Dubliners."

No wonder (framed this way) the idea of revision can often provoke annoyance, boredom, or even fear. But what if the revision process was closer to John Cage’s “chance operations,” a completely spontaneous and open-ended experience of creativity? Or, what if, through revision, we could explore yet-undiscovered parts of ourselves? Unlock new literary superpowers? Most importantly, what if revision could be fun? A revision-oriented poetry workshop, the course will prompt students to write and re-write their poems throughout the semester. Rather than prioritizing writing many new poems, we’ll prioritize working serially, episodically, writing several versions of the same poems, and seeing where we might end up through a series of games, exercises, chance operations, and experiments."

This rigorous reading list is then used as a springboard for cultivating diverse voices and stories in the classroom. The course’s seminar and workshop portions complement each other.

Our readings start with a famous twentieth-century example (e.g., Nabokov) and the comparative case of the establishment of modern Persian fiction before fast-forwarding to our contemporary moment and staying there, placing a stress on the U.S. American literary landscape. The idea of “outsiderness” serves as our entry. Together we ask how this outsider position opened up possibilities for these texts, both thematically and formally. What Others are produced in these texts, and what does Otherness look like within their pages?

We consider, and also critique, the popular idea buttressed by some theories of translation that there is something special about the so-called “mother tongue.” Putting those claims to task, we explore the politics of this feminization of language (i.e., why “mother?”). We furthermore consider how the idea of the mother tongue has been used as a tool of racist colonial policing, shutting racialized others out of official discourse. Recognizing that embracing a “mother” tongue has also been used as a tool of anticolonial resistance, that is, as a way to create space for a self threatened with erasure, we nevertheless consider authors who claim space in and through English-as-imperial tongue, whether by explicitly rejecting the mother tongue (e.g., Yiyun Li) or by more vexedly treating English as a site of loss and melancholia (e.g., Valeria Luiselli, Jhumpa Lahiri) – or still more, by embracing diglossia and multilingualism (e.g., Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie) alongside self-translation. Our workshop utilizes this heterogenous mapping to make room for your work and your peers. We will devote the same time and attention to one another’s work as to this published literature. Our readings might also open room for experimentation with new themes or forms."

Eliot famously said, “Dante and Shakespeare divide the world between them.” Agree or disagree, but the work of Dante Alighieri, the fourteenth century Florentine poet and statesman, remains vital to the study of poetry and its history—particularly as the lyric tradition intersects with long-form narrative and Christian allegory begins reconciling with pagan mythology in the lead-up to the Italian Renaissance.  Descending into that iconic and allegorical landscape shot through with the freezing exhalations of Lake Cocytus and populated by some of history’s most famous artists, thinkers, influencers, and bad actors, we will closely read and compare four different translations of the Inferno, the first section of Dante’s masterwork, the Divine Comedy. With great care, we will attempt to unravel the Inferno’s dense tapestry of symbols and literary allusions; parse its various themes, such as sacred and profane love, exile, suffering as purification, and radical empathy; and compare the translators’ respective approaches to the problems and opportunities of the original’s form (hendecasyllabic terza rima), diction, music, narrative apparatus, voice, and imagery."

But we lack exhaustive data. Gearing up for such data collection the next few years in a faculty-driven project at Bennington, this course provides an overview of the broader ethical and social landscape around diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) in publishing. Major inquiries will include:

How white is publishing? I.e., who are the editors, agents, etc.?
How white is writing? I.e., who is able to get published?
Do writers of color have to accent or exaggerate their difference in order to fulfill white expectations, whether by publishers or audiences?
How white is the US American reading population? What’s the difference between readers (who might use libraries, etc.) and buyers (market consumers)?
What challenges exist in data collection? Surveying?
What sorts of gender bias exist and how do they intersect with race bias?
What about anti-queerness of various forms?
What is intersectionality? What are other ways of thinking about difference?
Please note that this course is designed to follow a colloquium model. Readings will be relatively light, but students are expected to come to class prepared, having digested the materials and ready to dig in critically and creatively. The meat of our inquiry will happen in class and active participation is key. Students will also be pursuing their own projects, culminating in presentations in which they lead class time, rather than the professor."

This course will serve as an introduction to statistical reasoning and understanding as well as bolster the ability to think critically about data, its sources, and how to convey a clear message from data. It will focus on bringing clarity to data presented, choosing the correct presentation for a given data set, and avoidance of deception. There are no prerequisites and will be accessible to all interested and willing students.

This course is appropriate for any students wanting to understand, interpret, and present statistics. Students who plan to seriously create and analyze their own statistics for their work should take Creation of Statistics, which may either be taken as a sequel to this course, or on its own.

These questions are at the core of mathematics, but also at the core of liberal arts. In mathematics, people have found rather detailed answers to how much certainty is possible, and have found fascinating limitations to our knowledge.

This course serves two purposes. Firstly, it is for intermediate mathematics students, who are moving from introductory classes (such as Linear Algebra, Quantitative Reasoning and Mathematical Modeling, or Euclid’s Elements) to more advanced theoretical mathematics. The class is also recommended for computer science students. However, no prior mathematics knowledge is assumed. Therefore, the class is also suitable for beginning mathematics students, for students of philosophy, and for anyone interested in these questions and seeking to improve their ability to reason and form clear arguments (ideally, every student at a liberal arts college!).

The core of the course will be analyzing and developing logical mathematical arguments in various contexts.

This is NOT just the algebra you know from high school. There are several perspectives one can take on linear algebra: it is a method for handling large systems of linear equations, it is a theory of linear geometry (including in dimensions larger than three), it is matrix algebra, and it is a theoretical structure that appears throughout mathematics, physics, computer science, and statistics. This course is necessary for students concentrating in mathematics, physics, or computer science, and may be useful to students in other sciences, economics, or any studies involving statistics. This course is a prerequisite for Multivariable Calculus. Applications of linear algebra include correlation coefficients and linear regression in statistics, finite element methods in physics and engineering, analysis of networks, computer graphics, google page rank, error-correcting codes, and data compression. (Linear algebra is also central to quantum mechanics, though we will not cover that application.)

Note that in our non-standard calculus sequence, we do not cover some standard computational techniques of calculus in the introductory course MAT 4288 Calculus: A Classical Approach. Some of those techniques will be covered in this class instead. Therefore, this class can be a good choice for students who took Calculus: A Classical Approach and want to go further with calculus."

The goal will be to creatively and collaboratively develop a solution for the problem, and professionally present the results of their work to the partner organization. The partner organization and specific problem we will focus on will be chosen by fall registration. This course is for students with strong mathematical preparation and likely will be relevant to students with interests across the sciences. Student success will depend on realistic industry evaluations such as teamwork, communication, individual initiative, and final products.

Students in their second, third or fourth years of study with focuses across science, mathematics, and computer science with significant mathematical background are encouraged to talk to the instructor about this course and the way that their skills might contribute to the chosen problems."

Number theory asks questions about whole numbers: for example, are there infinitely many fundamentally different “Pythagorean triples”, where two whole number perfect squares add to a third, such as 3^2 + 4^2 = 5^2 ? Which other whole numbers can be written as a sum of two perfect squares? These questions have a rich history. Natural questions lead to surprising answers and clever techniques, introducing new ideas which then take on their own life.

The class will be taught with a number of optional topics, so that students taking it directly after Logic and Proof can concentrate on the core material, while more senior students can go into more depth in topics of interest. Note that Calculus is not a prerequisite for this class."

Our focus will be on the sonic capabilities of the program, though we will dip occasionally into visuals, video, and sensing technologies. Students will develop research and projects based on their interests and abilities, and must have an independent streak for troubleshooting and communal problem solving. Smaller exercises will show how to reproduce analogue problems in the digital realm, and bring us towards a sonic understanding of both. Visiting specialists will show how to bring Max into diverse interactions with other disciplines, from motion sensors, image tracking, to integration with Arduino and other devices."

We will study synthesis in depth, and the development of early analog synthesizers, while learning how these techniques have influenced contemporary software design. While the class will focus on composing, students will be expected to learn how to use VCV Rack, and Madrona Labs software. We will have weekly critiques of works-in-progress, and the class will culminate in the creation of a collaborative mix-tape of student compositions.

It is meant for fledgling composers, for those who may have composed a lot of music already but have trouble writing their music down, or for those who have never even imagined composing music but would like to try. There are specific composition assignments approximately every other week. Musicians visit the class first to explain their instruments and return a second time to play and record what the students have composed for them. In tandem with this we explore and review notation and the rudiments of music. Over the course of the term we study and review the overtone series; the notation and hearing of rhythm and pitch (in treble and bass clef); intervals; the modes; major and minor scales; triads and chord formation;the circle of fifths; whole-tone and pentatonic scales, and the concepts behind twelve-tone music. We also study a bit of Music History. The course approaches music study through a progressive-education model, positing that students will be motivated to learn skills if they have a creative use for them.

The class is labeled a ‘4000’ level because it is intended for students who have taken instrumental lessons for a few years or more, and who can read music in at least one clef. It is recommended that students who are taking this course are concurrently taking instrumental lessons."

These collaborations helped revolutionize dance choreography, philosophies and musical methods from their use of tonalities, sonorities, textures, rhythms, narratives, and concepts producing innovative works that continue to inform and inspire. Surveying these collaborations will provide students with an informed understanding of the creative process, and how one can apply these processes to develop their own original work.

Students will collaborate in class while exploring methods that can be used in their creative process to develop music composition for dance, theatre, film, and other related disciplines. Class activities and assignments include, but are not limited to; reading about choreographers and composers, listening and examining music, viewing choreography on film and video, researching Bennington archives in dance and music, viewing and examining musical scores related to dance, creating narratives based on blood memories, responding to biographical readings in discussion, writing and presentation, creating an original music composition or choreography to be presented live or videotaped.

Playing an instrument is not required, however, having basic knowledge of recording music using Garage Band, Logic Audio, Ableton or other recording software is a plus. For dancers, being able to improvise movement and interact / dialogue with other dancers and musicians is necessary. Performing live is a goal, but not required."

The idea of the class is to gain fluency in the composing/notating process and confront some theory concepts along the way, by notating short pieces for piano following specific prompts. There will be weekly or bi-weekly composing assignments, some decided upon by the instructor, some determined by the group. Assignments could range from “Write a one-page two-part invention”, “Write a one page piece using jazzy rhythms”, “Write a short twelve-tone piece”, “Write a piece in a Rock piano idiom”, to “Write a short piece in which the pianist needs to talk as well as play”, “Write a piece for piano in which the keyboard is not used (and the piano is not harmed!)”."

What do we call this plein air musician, who might they be? If the Impressionist painter chased the light outdoors, what does the plein air musician chase? This class explores how we can incorporate field recorders as a provocation for new composition and use the history of Impressionism in painting as a guide towards novel approaches in recording and composing outdoors. There will also be an emphasis on production techniques, recording, site specific, and multichannel composition, as well as looking at the histories of sound artists who have experimented in similar veins."

What do you know that your sentient, feeling body did not first experience? How does music help you know and express yourself? Can music help you understand someone else?

Emile Jaques-Dalcroze (1865-1950) saw all music as a metaphor for the body experiencing itself. We don’t just hear music: we feel it. When a musician interprets a musical score, and plays the right notes at the right time, is it enough to move you? In Eurhythmics, (greek for ‘good flow’) we play with embodiment as the source of dynamic, felt experience, designing games of movement and music to challenge the depth and breadth of our awareness. What makes a rhythm groove? What makes a phrase beautiful? One Dalcroze student, Meredith Monk, summed it up this way: “All musical truth resides in the body.”"

This menu of courses introduced innovative pioneers of music who contributed to the lexicon and history of the black experience in America. Initially, Black Music courses were listed in the curriculum as extra-divisional or interdisciplinary courses from 1968- Spring 1974. Dixon boldly defended an affront from the administration who were not in favor of the teachings of Black Music as a separate entity from the general music curriculum. Students engaged in these courses rallied to defend Black Music Studies during that period, which is documented in the archives. After Fall 1985 courses were listed in the curriculum under Music. Black Music: Black Music Division concentrated on music composition, improvisation, visual art, poetry, literature, dance, and performances that reflected the immense contributions that were often overlooked and unpraised in comparison to the western aesthetic. Dixon’s compositions, teachings, and innovative approach to creative music boldly addressed a multitude of issues in the wake of the Civil Rights, Feminist, and Black Power Movements. This ever-evolving course reflects on the social, political, and cultural content created as an outcry from artists Nina Simone, Billy Holiday, The Last Poets, Amiri Baraka, Max Roach, Nickki Giovani, Basquiat, Public Enemy, Spike Lee, to present day performers, writers, and content producers and countless others.

The Bennington archives housing Black Music: Black Music Division is a portal for students to investigate how these movements instigated an awakening in the artistic and political community that inspired a revolution that continues today. These archives contain documentaries, photos, video, recorded, and written words from former students, faculty, and visiting artists. Students will have the opportunity to research how Black Music embodied itself here at Bennington College through this 50-year retrospective."

Yet this is actually a new perspective, one that neglects the long, intertwined histories of these religious groups. Large Jewish populations lived in the lands of Islam without interruption from the early 7th century through the 20th century and some continue to this day. There was an intense interaction between Islam and Judaism at all levels of culture and religion, especially music. From the perspective of music and sound, we will try to build a nuanced understanding of Muslim and Jewish collaboration, distinction, struggle, and cohabitation across the geographic region of the Middle East, encompassing present-day Turkey, Iraq, Egypt, Lebanon, Syria, Israel and Occupied Palestinian Territories, Iran, Morocco, and elsewhere. In this course, we will combine the study of music history and culture with hands-on music-making, dividing class time equally between lecture/discussion/listening and applied and active musical participation. We will study regional musics in their historical and religious environments from the early modern period to the present day. Our work will explore sound practices of the synagogue, mosque, religious festivals, life cycle events, folk song, art traditions and up to contemporary popular music. Other dimensions will include examining the relationship between Qur-anic recitation and Jewish cantorial chant, connections between Sufi mysticism and Kabbalah, improvisation, and how sound is necessary to the experience of ritual. Throughout the course we will welcome guest practitioners and scholars who will guide and deepen our understanding and care of the sound practices and traditions we are studying."

A blood-stained bride driven to despair and murder on her wedding night. An opium dream of a diabolical witches’ Sabbath. Composers and performers have represented horror, madness, magical creatures, and supernatural elements in innumerable and thrilling ways since the Middle Ages. In this course, we will study key musical works that engage with the supernatural. We will listen to and watch several operas, symphonic works, solo instrumental and vocal pieces, sacred musical works, and examples from popular music and horror film soundtracks. Throughout the course we will consider how composers built a rich musical language to depict the supernatural, often pushing the boundaries of harmony, melody, and rhythm and deviating wildly from established musical norms. We will learn how composers and their works were in active dialogue with the philosophical, scientific, religious, and literary movements of their time, reading excerpts of key works connecting musical aesthetics with magic, science, the visual arts, spirituality, the sublime, and the ambiguous boundaries between the natural and supernatural worlds. Our course will be brimming with infernal demons, benevolent deities, mischievous fairies, unhinged clowns, sorcerers, ghosts, tombs, caves, prophecies, dungeons, monsters and incredible music.

Homework will include readings, listening assignments, journals, brief in-class presentations, and papers."

How do we make a song more effective through focusing on guitar, how can we make a song find its destination? This course develops each student’s guitar practice in tandem with songwriting, while challenging players to hear all notes, chords, rhythms, and breaks as viable. Each student will write one “long song“ that pushes their playing outside their comfort zone and into a more dynamic relationship with their instrument.

By playing together, students will learn how blues, swing, Latin, and modern music elements have all fueled this music called jazz. Students will also learn how major jazz artists such as Ellington, Monk, Mingus, Wayne Shorter, Ornette Coleman and others have approached composition. As a group, we will explore different techniques for playing over chord changes and ways to make improvised solos more interesting, both harmonically and rhythmically. Whether playing a jazz standard, a student composition, or free music, the emphasis will be on listening and on interacting with each other, finding ways to create blend, groove, dynamic contrast, and tension/release.

We will learn some music by ear and other pieces will be read. Students will also be encouraged to bring in arrangements, transcriptions, and compositions, which will be read and developed by the ensemble. Students need to have adequate technique on a musical instrument, be able to read music and have a basic understanding of harmony (chord structures, chord-scales, etc.).

We will also focus heavily on intensive critical listening since listening is the key to playing more authentically. We encourage former students who have taken Jazz Ensemble to consider taking this class again to continue learning, exploring, and developing your instrument and knowledge of improvisation."

A kind of outlaw blues, rebetiko emerged from the poorest quarters of Athens in the 19th century, its songs typically dealing with themes of exile, wandering the streets after dark, taking drugs and drinking to excess, loving the wrong person, imprisonment, death, and the harsh lives of people displaced by war. The word “rebetiko” derives from the Turkish word “rebet,” meaning rebellious or disobedient and the songs revolve around the lifestyles of the “manghes,” people living by their wits, wheeling and dealing—classic antiestablishment gadabouts. Held in deep suspicion by the police, manghes, their songs and musical instruments were often banned for their blatant antiauthoritarianism. The genre evolved again after the 1923 Population Exchange Between Greece and Turkey, when a million and a half Greek refugees from Asia Minor poured into the urban centers of Greece, particularly Athens, finding themselves on the fringes of society. These newly arrived musicians—Jews, Armenians, Roma, and others— brought the rhythms, singing styles, and melodic modes of Turkey with them and developed a new genre of rebetiko called smyrneiko. Ultimately, rebetiko, its composers and performers became wildly popular through recordings and live performance, making an indelible mark on the evolution of Greek music. In this ensemble, we’ll learn the instrumental and vocal hits and hidden gems of rebetiko, focusing on iconic composers like Vassilis Tsitsanis, Markos Vamvakaris, and Apostolos Kaldaras, and magnetic performers like Roza Eskenazi, Rita Abadzi, Giorgos Mouflouzelis, Sotiria Bellou, and many more. We will develop an understanding of rebetiko performance practice—the singing and playing style, the feel of the rhythms, and the character of the songs. Along the way, students will learn about the colorful lives of rebetiko masters and the turbulent history of Greece in the first half of the 20th century."

The term soundscape refers to the range of sounds in a certain place and time, from a hospital’s array of beeping medical machines to the familiar noises of the places you call home. In this course, students will explore the concepts and creation of soundscapes in visual culture and media. We will cover histories and theories from scholars of environmental studies, and sensory studies, among other fields. We will analyze how sonic qualities are socially produced such as the ‘sonic color line’, and the cultural politics of music in Interwar Paris, and develop foundational visual analysis skills in visual and print media for further coursework in media studies. The course will include screenings of fiction and non-fiction media that we will analyze and discuss together.

In this course, we will study the telephone as an interdisciplinary device with a long history and divergent uses in order to learn key topics in media studies that also apply to many other technologies and phenomena. We’ll begin with Alexander Graham Bell’s collaborations with Helen Keller to develop the telephone, which we’ll analyze through disability and multisensory studies, key methods that extend to later uses of the phone as an accessible tool, from the video phone for sign language media to apps for visual impairment. Continuing with this rhetoric of embodiment and media, we will explore cases studies of gender and race, from early telephone operators to later cases of call centres, prison communication, and code-switching (as in Boots Riley’s Sorry to Bother You). We will also track the use of phones in horror and suspense films as a neoliberal beacon of increasing isolation and individualization. From examining the phone as a tool of representation, we will zoom out to questions of infrastructure, interface, and mediation, from geolocation and environmental impacts to apps, voice assistants, surveillance, and AR uses—from Pokémon Go to Apple Vision Pro."

This class is intended to serve singers who desire to be able to learn songs from sheet music (which will help prepare students for the more advanced 4000-level voice classes at Bennington), but would be useful for any student who wants to learn how to read music and sight-sing. Students will begin by learning the fundamentals of music notation: notes, rhythms, and musical terminology. By gaining familiarity with scales and intervals, and through the use of melodic exercises and song excerpts in varying styles, students will build a connection between the eye, ear, and voice to develop the muscle memory needed to be able to translate written melodic material into sound, on sight. Students will learn and sing excerpts of songs in varying styles, gaining musical independence in the process. Sight-singing is an invaluable and highly marketable skill for musicians of all styles, and opens up a world of possibility for both aspiring professionals and amateur lovers of music. 

This course is for true novices- it is not intended for students who already have experience reading music notation. No previous singing or musical experience is necessary to enroll, though it is highly recommended that students who enroll have the ability to match pitch (i.e. hear a pitch and then sing it back accurately)."

However, achieving this without harming the environment or compromising the needs of diverse groups across different contexts and timeframes is a challenge. How can we reconcile this tension and balance these competing priorities? This is the central question of sustainable development. In this seminar, we will delve into this question and examine the ethical principles guiding the goals of sustainable development. We will analyze the strategies used to achieve these goals in different communities and evaluate their success.

This course is open to all students, regardless of their academic year, and does not require prior knowledge of economics. We will explore fundamental concepts verbally and through written materials, employing visual aids such as graphs and charts to provide evidence supporting the ideas.

We will evaluate how government policies and various economic institutions influence and shape these variables, along with the economic forces that drive growth and fluctuations. Additionally, we will examine the long and short-term effects of these interventions on a nation’s economic conditions, including poverty and inequality.

This is an introductory course on macroeconomic theory and applications, designed for students in their first and second years of college. We will explore the basic ideas verbally and through written expositions, utilizing macroeconomic data to provide evidential support for our arguments. Graphs and mathematical formulations will be employed to express key concepts formally. Therefore, a grasp of high-school algebra and geometry is required, with some familiarity expected in spreadsheet analysis of data. Additionally, some knowledge of calculus will be advantageous.

The course has two requirements:
[1] Active class participation, grounded in thorough engagement with assigned materials
[2] Completion of a research project with related homework assignments.

This course introduces students to key features of capitalism as an economic system and a way of life that has had profound social and political consequences for human societies around the world. It is the primary aim of this course to get a better sense for what capitalism really is, and to uncover and evaluate some of the most compelling justifications and critiques regarding capitalism. We will examine questions such as: In what ways does capitalism free us and in what ways does it limit us? How does the market determine which commodities are valuable? Examining overlaps between economy and culture and looking systematically at the political, economic, and ethical project of capitalism will be a primary focus of the course. We will be attentive to the different ideological lenses through which capitalism is perceived and discussed as we examine phenomena such as wealth, labor, capital, commodities, and monopolies."

This shift suggests that our understanding of need is shaped by social, historical, and cultural context. In this class we will explore questions such as: how do we distinguish what we want from what we need to live a dignified life? Moreover, how might societies determine which types of needs should be satisfied through market exchange and which should not? Is the recognition of economic rights as important as the recognition of political rights? Through critical exploration of both heterodox and neoclassical economic texts, we will examine the concepts of subsistence, scarcity, abundance, need, want, preference, choice, and right."

What is the relationship between ‘work’ and ‘employment’? And how do the concerns of ‘nonwage work’—specifically care work within households—intersect with wage work within the labor market? These inquiries motivate our exploration. We will delve into established theories in labor economics and macroeconomics, enriching our discussions by drawing from political economy and social reproduction theory. Furthermore, we will investigate the evolution of ‘work’ and the dynamics of the ’employment relationship’ over recent decades, analyzing transformations in both the Global North and the Global South, especially in the post-COVID era. Throughout, we will examine how work influences individuals’ material well-being, shapes their living standards, and contributes to a region’s overall economic output and average income.

This advanced-level research seminar is tailored for third and fourth-year college students, with second-year students eligible with instructor approval. We will explore key concepts verbally and through written exposition, utilizing mathematical formulations for formal expression. The course will involve close analysis of macroeconomic datasets, requiring prior knowledge of data analysis and familiarity with spreadsheet analysis.

To be ethical is to choose the mean between extremes. Happiness is not a goal, but a state. In popular culture, Aristotle’s ethical views are often represented in slogan form. In this seven-week course, we will interrogate and unpack the meanings of and ideas behind these slogans. We will carefully investigate the theory embodied in Aristotle’s central ethical work, Nicomachean Ethics. Throughout, we will consider such questions as: What is human flourishing and what constitutes a flourishing life? How does virtue (ethical character) fit into such a life? How are friends or family important to my life’s going well? What is it to voluntarily choose a course of action? What am I responsible for? How does my conduct contribute or detract from justice in the world? How might we educate for ethical development? In addition to closely reading Nicomachean Ethics, other readings may include philosophical responses to Aristotle’s ethics.

This, at least, according to Socrates in Plato’s Republic (403c5-6). The Greek word Plato uses for ‘love,’ here is ‘erotika,’ that is: erotics: passionate, intense desire such as one has for a lover. It is this kind of love that Plato insists we should have for the beautiful (the fine, to kalon). What does it mean to erotically love beauty (or Beauty)? What value does beauty have? Is it all in the eye of the beholder or could beauty be a transcendent ideal? Is beauty significantly connected to truth? To goodness? How is artistic value related to the beautiful? This course will explore these questions in the context of ancient Greek philosophy and its receptions. Likely readings will include works by Plato (Symposium, Phaedrus, Lysis), Aristotle (Poetics, Nicomachean Ethics), Plotinus (On Beauty), as well as more recent philosophical considerations."

(The International Center of Photography, 2014), A Matter of Memory: The Photograph as Object in the Digital Age (George Eastman Museum, 2016), and Photography is Magic (Charlotte Cotton, Aperture, 2015) attest, there are many contemporary artists whose work with photography draws increased focus to material and spatial concerns, and whose creative expression extends beyond traditional fine art prints to encompass experiments with alteration and intervention, scale, texture, form, and installation. Through group critiques, assignments, slideshows, and readings, this course explores the broad range of physical forms that photographic works can take. While learning about past and present artists who have pushed the boundaries of the medium, students will expand their own creative practices, research new materials and processes, and work to advance self-directed projects through feedback and revision. Designed for those who have taken Photography Foundations, and ideally at least one other four-credit photography course, Image Objects aims to challenge, complicate, clarify and deepen students’ understanding of their work in progress as they resolve its production both formally and conceptually."

How does the gendered and racialized body communicate through a photograph made in these spaces? What is communicated when figure and space intertwine? Throughout the history of photography, the human figure has been used to intentionally occupy and alter physical spaces. In this course students will explore how the human body can transform interior and exterior space using available light. They will look at work by photographers who have examined these ideas in both formally aesthetic and symbolic ways. These images will serve as inspiration for the work that will cover the course assignments. Class discussions of readings, peer critique of works in progress will be central components of the coursework."

Academic and policy interest in such institutions is flourishing as previously authoritarian states seek to craft democratic constitutions, while established and new democracies contend with non-democratic, illiberal, or populist challenges to their political systems. This course introduces students to major political institutions and the debates about their relative merits. Readings, assignments, case studies, and class discussions and presentations will explore institutional structures and choices in contemporary polities, including parliamentary and presidential systems; federal and unitary arrangements; plurality and proportionality electoral designs; formal and informal political institutions; the nature of “hybrid” political systems; and problems of institutional design in transitional political or constitutional contexts."

The program will draw from psychological empirical research on gender and sexuality across history and culture and emphasizes the intersections of race, ethnicity, class, ability, and immigration in people’s experiences and identities. We will explore how gender and gendered practices have been studied in relation to macro-social processes, such as patriarchy and capitalism, but also how they form meanings in the physical and psychological lives of individuals. We will look at how gender and sexuality are embedded in contested relations of power in diverse communities and how feminist psychologists have explored the possibilities for change in and beyond academia.

Course themes will include: history and frameworks of the psychology of gender and sexuality, gender deconstructed, feminist methodology and ethics, psychological well-being, body politics, sexuality and desire, reproductive justice, gender and labor, structural and direct violence, healing, and solidarity and agency.

This class will be taught in a hybrid format. We will meet for seminar on Zoom most weeks, with in-person meetings during select weeks. Students will have the option to complete peer group work in-person or on Zoom."

Nearly 80 years ago, fleeing the rise of Naziism in Europe, Polanyi arrived at Bennington, and gave a series of public lectures that offered a bold new interpretation of what had gone wrong as the world fell into unprecedented turmoil. Soon, he was hard at work writing these early thoughts into what became his magnum opus, The Great Transformation: The Political and Economic Origins of Our Time. As the war and the manuscript both neared completion in 1944, Polanyi left the final revisions in the hands of colleagues at Bennington College as he rushed back to Europe to put his stunning synthesis to work rebuilding the world.

This class will be structured into two parts. Over the first half of the term, we will read and dissect The Great Transformation through a range of disciplinary lenses, including political economy, anthropology, and politics. The second half of the term will focus on using concepts and tools from the social sciences and humanities to consider the applicability of Polanyi’s ideas to today’s most pressing issues: globalization and market fundamentalism; the rise of hypernationalism and xenophobia; climate change and the commodification of nature; and the potential for reinvigorating democracy."

Initial course content will include a review of basic quantitative social science research methods, and content on the development of feasible research questions and sampling choices. Students will submit an institutional review board application, and we will discuss ethical issues related to student projects (e.g., consent and privacy protection). We will discuss measurement tools and survey construction. Subsequent lecture content will be responsive to students’ needs, but will likely focus on troubleshooting participant recruitment, ethical data storage, and data management. Although the course will focus primarily on collecting survey data, students who are interested in collecting experimental or administrative data can find a space here; all students will discuss their project with the instructor before admittance into the course."

The class will be based primarily on mastering methods of working with materials that we come across in this everyday modern life. Foundational understanding of these materials in their raw states; synthetic/organic. Observing proximity; understood/understanding. You will begin to design informed decisions on material selection and their safe manipulations to create and develop new rich conceptual directions. Questions about questions like: Is this the most interesting solution? What is interesting? What is a more valuable piece of matter? Why are objects made out of specific materials and what in the consumer world relates to these material selections? Could it be something that will degrade (as all does) in this art world and, is it okay to be more aware of this reality?
The foundation of this course is designed around the encouragement to experiment fearlessly towards finding a richer material language and recognize the importance of body awareness to reach efficient production methods. There will be 3 projects during this seven week intensive design course. Each project will build upon the last to allow for a consistent flow and understanding of the complex material properties and their relationships of this World. This class will cover working methods such as, but not limited to, tapping and dieing, cutting, sanding and polishing, casting and mold making with multiple materials."

A few weeks into term we will participate in an Iron Pour, understanding the practices of shaping wax and preparing sand-molds for participation. The students will also be introduced and immersed within a community of artists off campus. This class will continue to demonstrate known material manipulations of classical processes; however, will encourage further exploration of more contemporary approaches as the class moves forward. We will use materials such as, but not limited to, wood, steel, plaster, wire mesh, alginate, cardboard and clay, as well as non toxic glues and hardware and fasteners. The students will become knowledgeable of safety procedures and understand how to use the woodshop’s basic hand and stationary tools efficiently. The class will have four to five main projects over the period of the term. Each project will have a prompted topic for the student to respond alongside a set variety of materials to work with. These materials restrictions, early in term, will allow the students to become creative on the most basic levels. The students will learn to become innovative and invent ways to work around a problem. We will understand and practice building works within a physically productive studio. Each student will be responsible for keeping a journal/drawing that is split up per project. In addition, each student will consistently propagate a digital folder, organized by project, that will contain websites, images and inspirational findings. This practice will act as a reference for student responsibilities as well as open conversation around portfolio building. These digital folders will also aid in preparations for individual presentations, randomly called upon throughout the term. There will be regular project related presentations that will complement individual group critiques."

Whether you are a seasoned sculpture student, or have always wanted to learn how to weld, this course is a great way to be introduced to the fundamentals of mild steel design methods. This course is open to all that are curious!

Students will learn the basics of welding, metal-shop equipment, shop safety, and fabrication techniques.

Please note that this course may require additional materials to be purchased by the student.

This course requires an additional 3 hours of work per week in order to complete the projects and tasks assigned. Students are encouraged to work together during this time to ensure support and safety.

The goal is for students to become fully versed in issues that define traditional and contemporary sculpture. Regular individual and bi-monthly critiques with visitors will be complemented by student presentations pertaining to their work. Students will produce a visual presentation that highlights their interests, influences, and exploration. Each student will be required to propagate a visual journal as it pertains to their generative studio practice and be able to talk about how their work might be viewed in current worldly events.

While there will be some discussion of standard tactics such as stylistic nuances and artists’ biographies, it is expected that we will rapidly develop sufficient ability to focus on movements, theory, and politics, thus treating the works as ideologemes, representations of social import touching on several fields. The usual tactics associated with mastering a foreign language – explicit grammar sessions, vocabulary, oral and aural practice, text – will be on offer, but they will generally be student-driven, servicing the content, corroborating the hope that in confronting our own preconceived notions of the Spanish-speaking world we will simultaneously debunk those regarding how a language is taught. Students will therefore learn to speak, listen, read and write in increasingly meaningful scenarios. Conducted predominantly in Spanish. For beginners."

In this course, we will explore the different ways in which each of these artists use images to capture and re-frame the complexity of their cultural heritage, as well as the beauty and intricacies of their daily lives and surroundings, and, in the case of Guzmán, the search for the remains of “disappeared” loved ones. By doing so, we will also dive into how their works raise awareness about the role of aesthetics in helping memory to retell its multiple and meaningful stories in the most vivid, creative, and imperishable manner. The focus of the course is on student-generated discussion, and critical thinking about these media, but continual practice in all four major areas of language (listening, speaking, reading, and writing) is essential.

Which historic, cultural, and literary implications are behind this colloquial expression? How did (and does) Surrealism manifest in Modern Latin American artistic expressions, and how is that manifestation connected to Pre-Columbian cosmology? In this course, we will study the premises of the French surrealist manifesto, examining its relationship with the Pre-Columbian art and culture, as well as with the technological upheavals and global impact of World War I. Then, we will study Latin American Surrealists; their practice and production, and their ongoing impact on contemporary Latin American poetry and art. Finally, we will start to trace the communicating vessels that potentially unify a Latin American identity that is in a constant transformation and reformulation of itself. To this end, we will divide the course into two parts: In the first, we will go over a wide array of theoretical texts related to Surrealism and Pre-Columbian cosmology (Mary Ann Caws, Melanie Nicholson, George Bataille, and Keith Jordan). In the second part, building on those theories, we will examine a diverse of surrealist cultural products-poems, paintings, photographs, journals, and multidisciplinary works. The focus of the class will be on student-generated discussions and critical thinking about texts and concepts, and students will debate their own perspectives, both in conversation and in writing, thus developing analytical and linguistic skills.

We will also dive into a variety of literary genres such as poetry, short stories, micro stories, and chronicles. Then, students will have the opportunity to exercise their creativity imitating, modifying, intervening and/or offering a unique creative text in dialogue/response/discussion with the several texts read and analyzed. The time of the classroom will be used for each student to share their creative pieces and receive feedback from the classmates and the professor. There will be many opportunities to review drafts.

Our goal is to gain a greater understanding of Benjamin’s significance for cultural producers across disciplines, in particular artists, critics, and curators. Texts range from his seminal essays such as “The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction” to Benjamin’s enigmatic masterwork, the Arcades Project. Close readings of assigned texts are coupled with lectures and student research on contemporary examples of Benjamin’s influence—including engagement with a Usdan Gallery exhibition about personal collecting.

What exactly is the “art world”? How does what I am learning in college apply to life afterwards? This seminar course will address and explore why there is no clear or singular path to “becoming an artist” and offer students the tools to navigate shaping their artistic path from an empowered position.

Together we will tackle the practical aspects and issues of continuing to create art after graduation alongside a critical investigation of the political, economic, and cultural structures of the contemporary art world. We will explore topics related to the major institutions of the art world such as: commercial galleries, private collectors/collections, non-profit spaces, artist-run spaces, museums, universities/graduate programs, auction houses, grants/public art programs, artist residencies, art publications, and more. This course is geared towards senior Visual Arts students (working in any medium) interested in or genuinely curious about pursuing a creative life as a practicing artist after graduation.

This is a fully remote course. In class time will consist of virtual meetings consisting of slideshow presentations/short lectures, discussions, visits/presentations from professionals working in various art world institutions and artists at different stages of their careers, and some asynchronous work. Course work and assignments will consist of readings, watching videos/films, written responses to materials presented, research projects/research presentations, and the development and refinement of materials needed to apply to opportunities after graduating such as: artist statement, artist bio, portfolio, project/grant proposal etc. Investigating your own artistic practice via writing, discussion, and research is central to this course."

― André Berthiaume

The Scriptorium, a “place for writing,” is a class for writers interested in improving their critical essay-writing skills. We will read to write and write to read. Much of our time will be occupied with writing and revising—essai means “trial” or “attempt”—as we work to create new habits and productive strategies for analytical writing. As we write in various essay structures with the aim of developing a persuasive, well-supported thesis statement, we will also revise collaboratively, improve our research and citation skills, and study grammar and style. We will strive for clarity, concision, and expressiveness as we read and respond to a variety of historical and contemporary texts.

This Scriptorium is about the complex relationship between who we are and who we present to the world, and how this relationship changes over time. We will think about this topic in a variety of contexts ranging from racial passing to gender and sexual covering to forms of becoming in contemporary fandom and transgender literature. When is masking necessary to survive or thrive? To what degree does masking involve concealing or revealing one’s identity? We will think about masks and metamorphoses in novels, short stories, poetry, drama, autobiographical prose, films and graphic novels. Our readings may include primary works by Langston Hughes, Nella Larsen, Oscar Wilde, Eliza Haywood, Charlotte Charke, Shakespeare, Ovid, James Baldwin, Liana Finck, Casey Plett, Cameron Awkward-Rich, Ash Kreis; and critical texts by Judith Butler, Jack Halberstam, Hortense Spillers, Laura Mulvey, bell hooks, Danzy Senna, Jennifer Nash, Andrea Long Chu, and Caroline Bynum Walker."

Conversely, what do they offer that cannot be found anywhere else? We will voyage across worlds portrayed in novels, short stories, films, and video games. Our readings and media may include primary works by Ursula Le Guin, N.K. Jemisin, Octavia Butler, Kazuo Ishiguro, Jonathan Swift, Jason Roberts, Daniel Kwan and Daniel Scheinert, Samuel Johnson, Alice Munro; and critical texts by Jenny Odell, Dipesh Chakrabarty, Benedict Anderson, Lauren Berlant, and Dora Zhang."

We will read to write and write to read. Much of our time will be occupied with writing and revising—essai means “trial” or “attempt”—as we work to create new habits and productive strategies for analytical writing. As we write in various essay structures with the aim of developing a persuasive, well-supported thesis statement, we will also revise collaboratively, improve our research and citation skills, and study grammar and style. Our learning goals include practicing to write with complexity, imagination, and clarity. This Scriptorium’s readings will center on the themes of femininity and masculinity—and gender performance in between and beyond; we will watch the film Barbie (Greta Gerwig 2023) as a beginning. We will also study critical essays and theory to provide a framework for our discussions. (This is not a Creative Writing course.) Our readings may include the following authors: Gloria Anzaldúa, Honoré de Balzac, Jorge Luis Borges, Octavia Butler, Ted Chiang, Shohini Chaudhuri, Bora Chung, Denise Duhamel, Michel Foucault, Manuel Gonzalez, Stuart Hall, Donna Haraway, Ursula K. Le Guin, Clarice Lispector, Audre Lorde, Nina MacLaughlin, Aoko Matsuda, Herman Melville, Alice Munro, Sianne Ngai, Ovid, Patricia Pinho, Rainer Maria Rilke, Karen Russell, and David Trinidad. And, we may read from the following authors for their relevant critical or personal essays, philosophy, and theory: Lauren Berlant, Judith Butler, Jeffrey Jerome Cohen, Mary Douglas, Michel Foucault, Jack Halberstam, bell hooks, Laura Mulvey, and Riki Anne Wilchins."
